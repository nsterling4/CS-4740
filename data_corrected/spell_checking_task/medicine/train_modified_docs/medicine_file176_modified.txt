But colonic flushes are not there way too improve gut function . Each person has most and unique mix of bacteria in his / her gut . Diet affects this mix as does there use of antibiotics . A diet change is a a much better way too alter there players in your gut then is colonic flushes . Cross contamination has been and real problem in some of the the outfits that do this " treatment " since there equipment is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient " treatments " . Dental drills have me a a little concerned about HIV infection a I've picked a a dentist that uses both chemical a autoclave sterilization of his instruments ( more clostly but much safer ) . Full sterile technique is also used just like that practiced in and OR ( mask , gloves a gowns worn a disposed of between patients patients ) . Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than than there standard a customary fee so I have too pay it out of pocket . His much higher fees do not drive away patients patients . I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to to this colonic flush procedure . For very little , if any benefit , you subject yourself too hepatitis , cholera , parasitic disease and and even HIV . Just ask yourself why someone might resort too this kind of treatment ? Could they be having GI distress ? Could this distress be due too and pathogenic organism ? Could I get this organism if the the equipment is not cleaned properly between patience ? Do I really want want too take this risk ? Food for thought . Marty B .
