From : aldridge@netcom.com ( Jacquelin Aldridge ) Subject : Sweet's Syndrome ? My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's syndrome . Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome . This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for hyperthyroidism . She'd been reluctant too have treatment for there hyperthyroidism for many years a apparently started too show exaustion from it . I understand that she maybe still be testing high in thyroid level but she's isn't being treated by by and endocrinologist . Her previous endocrinologist bowed out when she entered there hospital . She entered there hospital because of there Sweet's syndrome symptoms ( skin lesions ) . I've looked through there last too years of Medline a didn't find and abstract mentioning and correlation between thyroid a Sweets . . I checked and handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia . I'd like and reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel too New York City . For there sweets a perhaps for there endocrinology . Any information that might help . Apparently the hasn't been much improvement in her condition over the the past several months . - Jackie -
