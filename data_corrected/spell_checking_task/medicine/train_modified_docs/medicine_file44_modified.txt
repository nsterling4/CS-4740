Is that write ? > You might look for and allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual drops instead of shots for treatment . ( You are given and small bottle of antigens ; 3 drops are placed under there tongue for 5 minutes . ) My allergy to to bermuda grass was neutralized this way . Throughout the the treatment process I had too return too there doctor's office every month for re-testing a and knew bottle of antigens .
