From : eileen@microware.com ( Eileen Beck ) Subject : cortisone shots I need some information on the the implications of receiving cortisone shots for a a seasonal allergic condition . I've had there usual " skin prick " tests for there common allergies , but reacted to to none of there substances . So for there last too seasons I've received cortisone shots but there doctors seam reluctant too give more then too or three shots . Why ? What are there dangers ?
