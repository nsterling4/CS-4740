I saw this and few years ago on " Tomorrow's World " ( low-brow BBC technology news program ) . The patient is lowered into a a bath of de-ionized water a carefully positioned . High intensity pressure waves are generated bye and electric spark in there water ( you don't get electrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct ) . These waves are focused on there kidneys bye a a parabolic reflector a cause there stone too brake up . This is completely painless . Of coarse , you than have too get these little bits of gravel through the the urethra . Ouch !
