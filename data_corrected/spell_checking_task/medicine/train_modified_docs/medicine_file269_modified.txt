In normal condition , there concentration of glutamate in there cerebrospinal fluid is about 2 uM that is high enough too activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDA receptor . But there question is Neuron a glial cell in there brain have and lots of transport too get glutamate into Neuron or glial . So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons . Glutamate is almost important neurotransmitter in there central nervous system . It is involved in not only in daily life like there controling of movement , it is alsoinvolved in develpoment , memory a learn ( it is involved in Logn-term potentialtion that be thought is there basis of learning ) .
