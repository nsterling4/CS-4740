Just don't force it on others . If you have food that you wont too enhance with msg just put there MSG on there table like salt . It is then then there option of there eater too use it . If you make and commerical product , just leave it out . You can include and packet ( like some salt packets ) if you desire . Salt , pepper , mustard , ketchup , pickles ... are table options . Treat MSG there same way . I wouldn't shove my condiments down your throat , don't shove yours down mine . WFL - - Walter Lundby
