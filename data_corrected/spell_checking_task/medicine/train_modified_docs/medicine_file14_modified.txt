From : marco@sdf.lonestar.org ( Steve Giammarco ) Subject : Help . Info : CLARITIN ( Allergies ) My doc handed me 10mg samples of CLARITIN ( brand of Ioratadine Tablet from Schering Corp . ) I tried too find it in there PDR too no avail . I do remember she mentioned this drug was relatively knew too there US but available overseas for quiet some time . Looking mostly for side-effect , contraindications , a mode of action such that it differs from Seldane and and Hismanal . Email or newsgroup is fine . Thanx in advance . - - Steve Giammarco / 5330 Peterson Lane / Dallas TX 75240 marco@sdf.lonestar.org loveyameanit .
