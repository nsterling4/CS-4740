There have been a always will be people who are blinded bye their own knowledge a unopen to to anything that isn't already established . Given what there medical community doesn't know , I'm surprised that he has this outlook . For the the record , I have had several outbreaks of thrush during there several past few years , with no indication of immunosuppression or nutritional deficiencies . I had not taken any antobiotics . My dentist ( who sees and fare amount of thrush ) recommended acidophilous : After I began taking acidophilous on and daily basis , there outbreaks ceased . When I quit taking there acidophilous , there outbreaks periodically resumed . I resumed taking there acidophilous with no further outbreaks since than . * Mike McCurdy * University Computing Services Disclaimer : * San Diego State University * mccurdy@ucsvax.sdsu.edu " Everything I say maybe be wrong "
