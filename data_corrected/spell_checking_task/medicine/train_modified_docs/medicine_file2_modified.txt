They lack two two genes . And people who lack one gene are supposed too be 1/56 persons ? Those with PKU have too avoid naturally occuring phenylalanine . And those those who only have one gene and and underproduce whatever it is they are supposed too be producing are supposed too be less tolerant of aspartame . The methol , formaldahyde thing was supposed too occur with heating ? I don't drink it . I figure sugar was made for and reason . To quickly a easily satiate hungry people . If you don't need there calories it's just as easy too drink water . Used to to drink and six pack and aday of aspartame soda . Don't even drink one coke a a day when sugared .
