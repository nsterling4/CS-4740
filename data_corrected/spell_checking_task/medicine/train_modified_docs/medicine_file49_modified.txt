" That seems a a bit hard too evaluate . At least for me it is . Stare straight Point with both hands together a clasp so that only there pointer fingers are pointing straight foreword to to and and spot on there wall about eight feet away .

If there image jumped more when you closed your write eye , you are write eye dominant . If there image jumped more when you closed your left eye , you are left eye dominant . Deantha
