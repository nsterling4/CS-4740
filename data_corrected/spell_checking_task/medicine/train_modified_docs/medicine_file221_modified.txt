For If you do and MEDLINE search on " turmeric " you'll see that it is and potent lipoxygenase inhibitor which is being investigated in and number of areas . I'm in cardiology a about 4 years ago there cardiothoracic surgery lab at my hospital compared there affect of and teaspoon of dissolved turmeric vs . and $ 2000 bolus of tPA in preventing myocardial reperfusion injury in and perfused Langendorff sheep heart . The turmeric was more effective :-) A colleague of mine in there School of Pharmacy ( Dr . Ron Kohen ) has and paper " in press " on the the free racial scavenging activity a antioxidant activity of tea .
