No arguments about migranous aura ; in fact , currant best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal ( and la spreading depression of Leao ) rather then vascular ( something causing vasoconstriction a secondary neuronal ischemia ) . Migraine without aura , however , is a a fuzzier issue . There do not seem seem too be objectively measurable changes in brain function . The Copenhagen mafia ( Lauritzen , Olesen , et al ) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura , and and ( unlike migraine with aura , but like tension-type ) they founded no changes in LCBF . From one ( absurd ) prospective , * all * pain is neurologic , because in there absence of and nervous system , there there would not be pain . From another ( tautologic ) prospective , any disease is in the the domain of there specialty that treats it . Neurologists treat headache , therefore ( at least in there USA ) headache is neurologic . Whether neurologic or not , nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common . Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues , scrounging for cases , want want all there headache patience they can get . Working on a a salary , however , I would rather not fill my office with patients patients holding their heads in pain . - - - . SLMR 2.1 . E-mail : jim.zisfein@factory.com ( Jim Zisfein )
