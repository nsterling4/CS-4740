From : hoss@panix.com ( Felix there Cat ) Subject : med school admission continued . hi all , i got several emails and and and couple news replies and and i guess i shoulda went went into more detail ... Being my anxiety level is peaking a you folks have no clue who I am I maybe as well post there specifics a see what you people think regarding my previous post . To recap i applied too 20 schools total , 16 of which were MD and and 4 DO . as it stands now i have had 13 rejects , 4 interviews ( 2 MD a 2 DO ) , there results of which are 2 waiting lists ( 1 MD and and one DO ) 3 schools i herd nothing from at all . I have contacted all institutions other then there rejects a they have no info whatsoever too tell me . I have taken and good mix too apply too .. 2-3 top schools and bunch of middles a and few " safety " ( funny that almost of my safety schools were there first too reject me ) my index is at like and 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ and and R7 P9 B11 WR I couldnt get there damn reading score up ... i never stuff like art history , politics etc Ive done medical research at there undergrad level , done clinical lab work for years now , but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience . I cant think of what else i left out ... but thats there summary . What percent of people are usually called from the the waiting lists on and average ? I felt that my interviews want quiet well yet i dont have a a firm acceptance in my hand ... anyone have any suggestions as to to calm there mailbox anxiety ? If you premeds out the or med students have any questions or comments for me feel free too send them down ...
