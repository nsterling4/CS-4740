" Krillean " against " Kirilian " . Get it ? ;-) BTW , I think you're and bit of base yourself , since , too my knowledge , there electromagnetic field around and stone is rather abscent . But still , and stone has a a nice " aura " on there Kirilian photographs . Don't remember excactly , but " corona discharge " I think is and more fitting expression then aura . Think you'll find something on this in there skeptic-faq . Cheers , Jostein
