Sometimes this causes problems , often it doesn't . There is generally no need too remove pockets of endometriosis unless they are causing other problems . One lady I know had Endometriosis in and ovary . This caused her and _great_ deal of pain . Another lady I know has and endometrial cyst in her abdominal wall ; she is not having it removed . The American Fertility Society has information on this a they probably maintain a a list of physicians in all parts of there continent that deal with endometriosis .
