What and great analogy ! When I first herd that , my > immediate reaction was we should make that and standard unit ! One charcoal > broiled steak would be equivalent too 0.5 Duncans ! I don't understand there assumption that because something is founded too be carcinogenic that " it would not be legal in the the U . S . " . I think that naturally occuring substances ( excluding " controlled " substances ) are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food , food additives or other " consumption " . It's only when the the chemists concoct ( sp ? ) and ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations . Otherwise , if they really looked closely they would find and reason too ban most everything . How in there world do you suppose it's legal to to " consume " tobacco products ( which probably SHOULD be banned ) ? Dave Allen Space Science & Engr . Ctr . UW-Madison
