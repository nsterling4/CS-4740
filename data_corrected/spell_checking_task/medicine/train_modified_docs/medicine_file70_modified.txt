From : egb7390@ucs.usl.edu ( Boutte Erika G ) Subject : M . contagiosem I was wondering if anyone had any information about Molluscous contagiosem . I acquired it , a fortunately got rid of it , but there question still lingers in my mind : Where did it come from ? The little bit of info that I have received about it in there past states that it can be transmitted sexually , but also occurs in small children on there hands , feet a genitalia . Any information will be greatly appreciated . " I grow old , I grow old ; I shall wear my trousers rolled . " - T . S . Eliot
