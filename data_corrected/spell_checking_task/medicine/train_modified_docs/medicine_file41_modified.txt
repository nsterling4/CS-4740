You somehow left = out there part about " we all ate there same thing . " Changes things and bit , eh ? Perhaps . Now , just what leads you too belief that it was MSG and and not some other ingredient in there food that made you ill ? = These people aren't condemning Chinese food , Mr .

That's what I get paid for . My understanding of astronomy is purely at there amateur level ( or below ) . So unless what I'm saying is directly related too VAX / VMS , don't hold me or my organization responsible for it . If it IS related too VAX / VMS , you can try too hold me responsible for it , but my organization had nothing to to do with it .
