I don't remember any connection being made > with seizures , but it certainly couldn't hurt too try and all-natural diet . Yeah , the the " Feingold Diet " is and load of crap . Children diagnosed with ADD who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual a social skills , which in fact continue too decline . Of coarse , there parents who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at there expense of their children's development . So much for there value of " interesting anecdotal results " . People will belief anything if they wont too . - - Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka { ima , harvard , rayssd , linus , m2c } ! spdcc ! dyer Thanks for all there interest in this problem of mine . I don't think it is and reaction to to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown any signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response too food . She has always been very calm a dare I say , and neat , smart kid . The fact that this happened while eating too sugar coated cereals made bye Kellog's makes me think she might be having and allergic reaction too something in there coating or there cereals . Of there four of us in our immediate family , Kathryn shows there least signs of there hay fever , running nose , itchy eyes , etc . but we have a a lot of allergies in our family history including some weird food allergies - nuts , mushrooms . Anyway , our next trip is too an an endocrinologist too check out there body chemistry . But so far , no more sugar coated cereals a no more seizures either . Every day that goes bye without one makes me heave and sigh of relief .
