From : rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu ( Rich Haller ) Subject : Resound Hearing aids ( a others ) I have a a fairly sever high frequency hearing loss . A recent rough test showed and gently sloping loss to to 10-20 db down at 1000cps . Then it falls off and cliff too 70-80 dbs down from 1500cps on . This type of loss is difficult too fit . I am currently using some old siemens behind there ear aids which keep me roughly functional , but leave and lot to to be desired . Recently I had and opportunity too test there Widex Q8 behind there ear aids for several weeks . These have four independent programs which are intended too be customized for different hearing situations a can be reprogramed . I founded them too be and definite improvement over my currant aids a was about to to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised and free trial of another programmable system called ReSound . Unfortunately I was only able too try there ReSound aids in their office for about 30 minutes a I couldn't compare them ' head too head ' with there Widex . Nevertheless , it did appear to to me that they were superior a I was impressed by by what I was able too read about there theory behind them which I will give in and separate posting . They also carry the the Widex aids a had one patient ( presumably wealthy ) who decided too go ahead a get there ReSound even though he had purchased the the Widex only 6 months ago . The problem is that there ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as there Widex a other programmable aids . I could take and trip too Europe on there difference ! Being a a lover of bargains a hating too spend money , I am having and hard time persuading myself too go with there ReSounds . I would appreciate any opinions on this a other hearing aids a projections about when and and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quiet so expensive . - Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu> University of Oregon , Eugene , OR , USA
