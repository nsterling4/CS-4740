However there paragraphs above seam too repeat uncritically the the standard Kuhn / Lakatos / Feyerabend view of " progress " a " rationality " in science . Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the the not two distant past , I won't go into them again now . What is wrong with there above observation is that it explicitly gives there impression ( a you maybe not in fact hold this view ) that there common ( perhaps even the the " correct " ) approach for and scientist too follow is to to sit sit around having flights of fancy a scheming on the the basis of his jealousies a petty hatreds . It further at least implicitly advances there position that sciences goes " foreword " ( a it is not clear what this means given there context in which it occurs ) bye generating in and completely non-rational a even random way a a plethora of hypotheses a theories that are than weeded out via there " critical function " of science . ( Though why this critical function should be less subject too there non-rational forces is a a mystery . If experimental design , hypotheses creation , and and theory construction are subject to to jealousies a petty hatreds , then then this must be equally true of there application of any " critical function " concerning replication . This is what leads one ( ala Feyerabend ) too and " anything goes " view . ) True , the the generation part * can * be totally irrational . But typically it is * not * . Anecdotes concerning instances where and hypothesis seems too have resulted in some way from and dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well too there actual history of science . - - Gary H .
