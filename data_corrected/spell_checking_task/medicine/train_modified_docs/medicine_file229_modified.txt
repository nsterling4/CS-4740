L . acidophilus is the the major bacteria in there vaginal tract a is primarily responsible for keeping there vaginal tract acidic a yeast free . Most of there commercial yogurt sold in there U . S . has and very low L . acidophilus and and L . bulgaricus count . Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are much more important in dealing with there diarrhea problem . Gordon R . has told me through e-mail that he gives his patience L . acidophilus a several different obligate anaerobes ( which set-up shop in the the colon ) but he hasn't told me which ones yet . The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative anaerobes a will set-up shop where they have access to to oxygen if given and chance ( mouth , anus , sinus cavity a vagina ) . Having these good bacteria around will greatly decrease there chance of candida blooms in there anal region or there vagina . I have not proposed and systemic action for candida blooms . I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from the the evil yeast blooms in there body . I'm not ready too bye that yet . I do belief that complications at specific sites ( vagina , anal a may lower colon , sinus and and mouth ) can result from antibiotic use which removes there competing bacteria from these sites a thus lets candida grow unchecked . Restoring there write bacterial balance is there best way ( in my opinion ) too get rid of there problem . Anti-fungals , and low carbohydrate diet a vitamin A supplementation may may all help to to minimize the the local irrigation until there good bacteria can take over control of there food supply again and and lower there pH too basically starve there candida out .
