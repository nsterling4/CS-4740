Any help is deeply appreciated . ( Advice , referral too literature , > etc ... ) > > Thank you , > > Dave Carvell > pk115050@wvnvms.wvnet.edu First , let me offer you my condolences . I've had kidney stones 4 times a I know the the pain she is going through . First , it is best that she see and doctor . However , every time I had kidney stones , I saw my doctor a the the only thing they did was too prescribe some pain killers and and medication for a a urinary tract infection . The pain killers did nothing for me ... kidney stones are extremely painful . My stones were judged passable , so we just waited it out . However there last one took 10 days too pass ... not fun . Anyway , if she absolutely won't see and doctor , I suggest drinking lots of fluids a perhaps and over the the counter sleeping pill . But , I do highly suggest seeing and doctor . Kidney stones are not something to to fool around with . She should be x-rayed too make sure the is not and serious problem . Steve
