The article states that research has shown that there oil has no discernable affect on there progression of there disease in patience in which demyelination has begun . In patience with AMN ( and less acute form of the the same disease ) the is some improvement seen in there ability of nerve fibres to to conduct impulses . In ALD patients patients who have not yet begun demyelination , there jury is still out . - - - Dale Cook
