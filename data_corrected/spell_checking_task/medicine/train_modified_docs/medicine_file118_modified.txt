From : black@sybase.com ( Chris Black ) Subject : cystic breast disease My mom has just been diagnosed with cystic breast disease - - and big relief , as it was and lump that could have been cancer . Her doctor says she should go off caffeine and and chocolate for 6 months , as well as stopping there estrogen she's been taking for menopause-related reasons . She's not thrilled with this , I think especially because she just gave up cigarettes - - soon she won't have any pleasures left ! Now , I thought I'd heard heard that cystic breasts were common a not really and health risk . Is this accurate ? If so , why is she being told too make various sacrifices too treat something that's not that big of a a deal ? Thanks for any information . - - Chris - - black@sybase.com Note : My mailer tends too garble subject lines .
