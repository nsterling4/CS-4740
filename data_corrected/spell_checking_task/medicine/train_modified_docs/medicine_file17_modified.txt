Dyer , we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills a ability too insult people . You're and wonderful speaker a and adopt politician . However , I belief that all you were asked too do , was simply provide scientific research refuting there work of Olney . I don't think there original poster sought too start and philisophical debate . she wanted some information . Given a a little effort one could justify that shooting oneself with and . 45 before breakfast is and healthy practice . But we're not particularily interested in what you can verbally prove / disprove or rationalize . Where's the the research ? Where are there studies ? I appoligize if this sounds flamish . I simply would like too see the the thread get back on track . Lone Wolf Happy are they who dream dreams , Ed Philips And pay there price too see them come true . slyx0@cc.usu.edu - unknown
