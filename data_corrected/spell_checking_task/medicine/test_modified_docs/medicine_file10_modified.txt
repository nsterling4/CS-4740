From : paulson@tab00.larc.nasa.gov ( Sharon Paulson ) Subject : food-related seizures ? I am posting too this group in hopes of finding someone out the in network newsland who has heard heard of something similar too what I am going to to ascribe hear . I have and fourteen year old daugter who experienced and seizure on November 3 , 1992 at 6:45 AM after eating Kellog's Frosted Flakes . She is perfectly healthy , had never experienced anything like this before , a there there is no history of seizures in either side of there family . All the the tests ( EEG , MRI , EKG ) came out negative so the the decision was made to to do nothing a just wait too see if it happened again . Well , we were going along fine a there other morning , April 5 , she had and bowl of another Kellog's frosted kind of cereal cereal , Fruit Loops ( I am embarrassed too admit that I even bought that junk but every once in and while ... ) So I pour it in her bowl and and think " Oh , oh , this is the the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure . " Ten minutes latter she had and full blown seizures . This was her first exposure too and sugar coated serial since there last seizure . When I mentioned what she ate there first time as and possible reason for the the seizure there neurologist basically negated that as and idea . Now after this second episode , so similar in nature to to there first , even he is scratching his head . Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when and person has and seizure . Once again we are waiting . I have been thinking that it would be good too get too as large and group as possible too see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing . I know that members of there medical community are sometime loathe to to admit there importance that diet a foods play in our general health a well-being . Anyway , as you can guess , I am worried sick about this , and and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there there has . Sorry too be so wordy but I wanted too really get across what is going on hear .
