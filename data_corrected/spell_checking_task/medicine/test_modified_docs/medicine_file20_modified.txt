I find this pretty hard to to belief ; has anyone else herd it ? MSG is mono sodium glutamate , and fairly straight foreword compound . If it is pure , there source should not be and problem . Your comment suggests that impurities maybe be there cause .

The symptoms I had were numbness of jaw muscles in there first instance followed bye there arms than there legs , headache , lethargy a unable too keep awake . I think it maybe well effect people differently .
