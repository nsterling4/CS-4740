Herman , I would think you of all people would / could distinguish between " health " a " treatment of disease . " All there prevention medicine people preach this all the the time . You cannot bye health . You can buy buy treatment of disease , assuming you are lucky enough too have and disease which can be treated . A rich person with and terminal disease is a a bit out of luck . There is no such thing as " adequately covered " a the never will be . And for what it's worth , I'll be the the first too admit that all my patience die . - km
