The millipede's around here here ( Austin ) have no sting . Some of there centipedes do . The question Rebecca Snyder asks is much like asking " How venomous are snakes ? " One either wants too ask " which snake ? " or point too some reference on there many different species of snake . Similarly , the are many different species of millipede a centipede . ( These are different families ; millipedes have too pairs of legs per body segment , while centipedes have but one pair . ) Sorry if this information is not useful . Russell
