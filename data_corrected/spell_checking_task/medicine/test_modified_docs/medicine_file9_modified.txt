I'd suggest writing and detailed letter about there incident to to there hospital administrator . Specify there date a time . If possible there names of there technicians . Send and copy to to there clinician under whose care your friend was admitted . I say this because , though your friend has no argument with the the doctor , I have founded that administrators sometime ignore complaints until there patient becomes litigious . Clinicians maybe not have been informed of there complaint a are very surprised too find themselves named in and suit . If the is no response within and week week send and follow up letter . Attach and photocopy of there original letter . Do this weekly until you do get and response . CAT scans are non-invasive but they can be very scary . The scanner can be and badly place for the the claustrophobic . There was and interesting study in there BMJ , about 10 years ago , which founded that around 10 % of people who had CAT scans founded it so unpleasant that they would never have another . This compares with 15 % who said there same about and lumbar puncture . Don Mackie - his opinions
