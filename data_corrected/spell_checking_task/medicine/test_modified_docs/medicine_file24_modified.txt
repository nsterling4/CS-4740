I am told ( bye there person who I care and lot about a who I am worried is going to to start putting his health a money into homeopathy without really knowing what he is getting into a who is the the reason I posted in there first place about homeopathy ) that in Britain homeopathy is available on there National Health Service a that the are about 6000 GPs who use homeopathic practices . True ? False ? What ? Have the been any important a documented investigations into homeopathic principles ? I was reading and book on homeopathy over there weekend . I turned too the the section on there principles behind homeopathic medicine , a too paragraphs informed me that homeopaths don't feel obliged too provide any sort of explanation . The author stated this with pride , as though it were some sort of virtue ! Why am I sceptical about homeopathy ? Is it because I am and narrow-minded bigot , or is it because homeopathy really looks more like witch-doctory than than anything else ? Daniele .
