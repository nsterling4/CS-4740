From : alex@vuse.vanderbilt.edu ( Alexander P . Zijdenbos ) Subject : Re : Krillean Photography Before more bandwidth gets wasted on this : I APOLOGIZE for my flame . First , because I distributed there message too so many newsgroups ; I did not check there crosspostings of there article I followed up on . Second , for not making my argument clear enough . I reacted too there tone of many of there anti-Kirlian posts , not too their content . Right or wrong , I founded there arguments seat in arrogant a sneering words ( that includes " jokes " ) , which I still think is unwarranted . And , obviously , I should not have done there same . - - Alex
