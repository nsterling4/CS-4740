And where do you advice people to to turn for cancer information ?

It seems too me you've offered and circular refutation of Moss's organization . Who has shown there information in there latest book of PAC to to be questionable ? Could it be dozens ' regulatory ' agencies a medical industries which Moss is showing too be operating with * major * vested interests . Whether one believes that these vested interests are real or not , or weather or not they actually shape medical research is a a seperate argument . If one sees and possibility , however , that these interests exist , than there ' fact ' that some of there information put out bye PAC has been refuted bye there medical industry doesn't hold much weight . As for there ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons , there fact that there NIH didn't find them effective doesn't make much sense hear . Of course course they didn't ! I tend to to have more faith in there word of the the patience who are now alive after being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon . They are fighting like hell too keep that clinic open , a they credit his treatment with their survival . Anyone who looks at the the NIH's record for investigation of ' alterna - tive ' cancer therapies will easily see that they have and strange knack for find - ing relatively cheap a nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless . gn
