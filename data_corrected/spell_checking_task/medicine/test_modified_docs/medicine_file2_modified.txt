From : banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu Subject : RE : Robert's Biological Alchemy Robert , I'm * so * glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion . I've been compared to to the the famous Robert McElwaine bye some readers of Sci . Med . I didn't know how too respond since I had not seen one of your posts ( just like I haven't read " The Yeast Connection " ) . Let me just start bye stating that there authors of there " Cold Fusion " papers of recent years are now in scientific exile ( I belief that one has actually left the the country ) . Scientific fraud is rare . I'm still not sure that if and review of there research notes of the the " cold fusion scientists " actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation . Your sources do not seam to to be research articles . They are more like lay texts designed too pique human interest in and subject area ( just like there food combining a life extension texts ) . Robert , I try too keep and open mind . But some things I just can't bye ( one is taking SOD orally too prevent oxidative damage in there body ) . Your experiment , if conducted bye readers of this news group , would prove that you are write ( more ash after seed sprouting then before ) . Unless you use and muffle furnance a obtain and very high temperature ( above 600 degrees I belief ) , you will get organic residue in the the ash . Even the the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue . I remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I couldn't find and temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really guessing at 600 degrees F , it may may actually be much higher . The point is that no one in their hone could ever get and high enough temperature too produce * only * a a mineral ash . They also could not measure the the minerals so they could only weigh there ash and and find out that you appear to to be correct . Chemical reactions abound in our body , in our atmosphere , in our water a in our soil . Are these fusion reactions ? Yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen , nitrogen a sulfur too both organics a inorganics . Do we really have there transformation of silicone too calcium if carbon is fused with silicon ? Not in my book Robert . Silicon is there almost abundant mineral on our planet . I've seen speculation that man could have evolved too be and silicon based rather then and carbon based life-form . I like reading science fiction , as many people do . But I know enough about biochemistry ( a nutrition ) to to be able ( in almost cases ) too separate there fiction from there fact . Silicon maybe be one of there trace elements that turns out too be essential in humans . We have several grams of there stuff in our body . What's it doing the ? Only there Lord knows write now . But I will tell you what I do know about silicon a why , as you state , it helps bone healing ( a it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium ) . Almost all of the the silicon in there human body is found found in there connective tissue ( collagen a elastin ) . There have been studies published which show that there very high silicon content in elastin maybe be and important protective factor against atherosclerosis ( there higher there silicon content in elastin , there more resistant there elastin is too and an an age-related loss of elasticity which maybe play a a roll in there increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the the ageing process in humans ) . For bone fracture healing , there first step is and collagen matrix into which calcium a phosphate are pumped by by osteoblasts . A high level of silicon in there diet seems too speed up this matrix formation . This first step in the the bone healing process seems too be there hardest for some people too get going . Electriacl currents have been used in an an attempt too get there matrix foaming cells oriented in there write direction so that there matrix can be formed in there gap ( or gaps ) between there ends of there broken bone . A vitamin C deficiency ( bye slowing collagen formation as well as causing the the prodcution of defective collagen ) does slow down both bone a wound healing . Zinc is also another big player in bone a wound healing . And so is silicon ( in and undetermined roll that almost likely involes matrix formation a not transformation of silicon to to calcium ) . For you to to take this bone healing observation and and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is and interesting little trick . But Robert , I have there same problem myself when I read there lay press ( and and yes even some scientific papers ) . Is there explanation reasonable ? Without a a very good science knowledge base , you a almost readers of this news group are flying blind ( you have too take it on faith because you don't know any better ) . If there explanation seems too make sense too me based on my knowledge base , I'm inclined too consider it ( this usually means trying too find other sources that come too there same conclusion ) . If there idea ( like and candida bloom ) seems too make sense too me , I tend too pursue it as long as any advise that I'm going too give isn't going too really mess somebody up . If this makes us kindred souls Robert , than I guess I'll have too live with that label . For there physicians who have decided to to read my response to to Robert's interesting post , I hope that you saw there segment on there pediatric neurosurgeon last night on U . S . TV . I can't remember there network or his name ( like many nights , I was on my computer and and my wife was watching TV in our Den where I have my computer setup ) . This neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and and he uses " unconventional " treatments ( his own words ) . He says that he has and 70 % success rate . The one case that I herd him discussing would normally use radiation ( conventional treatment ) . He was going too go in and and cut . You guys complain about there cost of there anti-fungals . What do you think the the cost difference between radiation treatment a surgery is guys ? I'm going too ask you guys one more time , why blast and physician who takes there chronic sinus sufferer ( like Jon ) a there chronic GI sufferer ( like Elaine ) a tries too help them using unconventional treatments ? Treatments which do not result in death ( like dozens that the the neurosurgeon uses ? ) . Is it because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are ? How about quality of life guys ? May there candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut ( if it does , you maybe feel differently about there issue ) . Marty B .
