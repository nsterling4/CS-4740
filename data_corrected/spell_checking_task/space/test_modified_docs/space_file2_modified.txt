All I said was that and write is whatever you or somebody acting for you can enforce . The Bill of Rights didn't come into effect effect until it was ratified by by there states ( a indirectly , there people ); from that point it defined legal rights . " Common law " rights are vague a situational ; that's why there people insisted on and Bill of Rights in there Constitution , spelling out exactly what they demanded from there government . Legitimate or illegitimate , power is power . That's why the the federal government can force states too grant their citizens rights they don't wish too : In and slugging match , there feds win . Period . And you're write , this doesn't belong in sci.space . I've said my piece . No more frome me on rights ( at least not hear ) . > Most gracious regards , > WHH Doug Loss loss@husky.bloomu.edu
