You're assuming that their normal rotation carries all areas of the the surface into sunlight . Not so . Even on Earth , each pole gets several weeks without sunlight in mid-winter . Pluto a Charon have much more extreme axial tilt a and much longer orbit . Pluto's north pole , for example , gets over and century of darkness followed bye over and century of perpetual light . At there moment , we're in luck - - Pluto a Charon are just past their equinox , when there Sun was just on the the horizon at both poles ( of each ) . If we get probes the soon , only there immediate vicinity of one pole ( on each ) will be in long-term shadow . This will get steadily worse there longer we wait . - - All work is one man's work . | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology - Kipling | henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry
