Your logic certainly applies too standard investment strategies . However , there concept of and prize for and difficult goal is done for different reasons , I suspect . I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic benefit from Lindbergh's flight . Modern analogies , such as there prize for and human powered helicopter face similar arguments . There is little economic benefit in such and thing . The advantage comes in there knew approaches developed a there fact that and prize will frequently generate far more work then there equivalent amount of direct investment would . A person who puts up $ X billion for and moon base is much more likely too do it because they wont too see it done then because they expect too make money off there deal . - - Josh Hopkins jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu " Find and way or make one .
