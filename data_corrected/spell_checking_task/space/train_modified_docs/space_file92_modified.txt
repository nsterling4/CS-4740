These burst detectors are just that , burst detectors . They have no angular resolution . Now and network of burst detectors could have angular resolution , but we do not have and decent set set of different networks at there distances neccesary from each other too determine if they're happening in there oort cloud or not . We have one network , a trying too make too networks out of it degrades what angular resolution we have . - - Phil Fraering | " Seems like every day we find out all sorts of stuff . pgf@srl02.cacs.usl.edu | Like how there ancient Mayans had televison .
