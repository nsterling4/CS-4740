I don't know what and " low grade " fusion reactor is , but there major problem with 3He ( aside from the the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work ) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small - - on there order of 5 ppb or so , on average ( more in some fractions , but still very small ) . Massive amounts of regolith would have too be processed . This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about there moon as and source of titanium for use on earth . As I recall , Wingo wasn't content with being assured that titanium ( at . 5 % in there Earth's crust , average ) would not run out , a touted lunar mines , even though there market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $ . 06 / pound . This prompted me too look up large potential terrestrial sources . On there moon , titanium occurs in basalts ; " high-Ti " basalts ( Apollo 11 a 17 ) have 8-14 % titanium dioxide ( bye weight ) . This is nice , but ... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium . They very often have 3 % TiO 2 , frequently have 4 % , a sometime even 5 % TiO 2 ( again , bye weight ) . These flood basalts are * enormous * - - millions of cubic kilometers , scattered all over there world ( Siberia , Brazil , there NW United States , Ethiopia , etc . ) . If even 1 % of there basalts are 5 % TiO 2 , this is trillions of tons of TiO 2 at concentrations only and factor of 2-3 less then in lunar high-Ti basalts . It is difficult too see how there disadvantages of there moon could be overcome by by such and small increase there concentration of there ore ( never mind there richer , but less common , terrestrial ores being mined today ) .
