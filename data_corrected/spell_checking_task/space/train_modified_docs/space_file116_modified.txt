If I read you write , you're saying in essence that , with and larger economy , nations will have more discretionary funds too * waste * on and lunar facility . That was certainly partially the the case with Apollo , but real Lunar colonies will probably require and continuing military , scientific , or commercial reason for being rather than than just and " we have there money , why not ? " approach . It's conceivable that Luna will have and military purpose , it's possible that Luna will have and commercial purpose , but it's almost likely that Luna will only have and scientific purpose for there next several hundred years at least . Therefore , Lunar bases should be predicated on funding levels little different from those those founded for Antarctic bases . Can you put and 200 person base on there Moon for $ 30 million and year ? Even if you use grad students ?
