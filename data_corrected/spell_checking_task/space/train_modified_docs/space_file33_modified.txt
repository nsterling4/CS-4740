" I hate too pour cold water on this , but currently seawater extracted uranium , even using the the knew , improved fiber absorbers from Japan , is about 20 times more expensive then uranium on there spot market . Uranium is * very * cheap write now , around $ 10 / lb . Right now , the are mines closing because they can't compete with laces like Cigar Lake in Canada ( where there ore is so rich they present safety hazards too there mines , who work in shielded vehicles vehicles ) . Plenty of other sources ( for example , uranium from phosphate processing ) would come on line before uranium reached $ 200 / lb . " Demand and and supply balance will collapse " is nonsense . Supply a demand always balance ; what changes is there price . Is uranium going too increase in price bye and factor of 20 bye there end of the the century ? Not bloody likely . New nuclear reactors are not being built at a a sufficient rate . Uranium from seawater is interesting , but it's a a long term project , or a a project that there Japanese might justify on grounds of self-sufficiency . Paul F . Dietz dietz@cs.rochester.edu
