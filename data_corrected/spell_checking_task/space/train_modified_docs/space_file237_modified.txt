Geez Allen any organization has costs but the is a a heck of and difference in legitimate costs , such as libraries and and other things that must be the too support a a program and and " wrap " as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap was on top of all of the the overhead which and couple of sentences down you say is not true .

You admit hear that this is wrong . Nasa has a a line item budget every year . I have seen it Allen . Get some numbers from that detailed NASA budget a dig out there wrap numbers a then then howl too high heaven about it . Until you do that you are barking in there wind . > > No Allen you did not .

Apollo integration was done hear at Msfc a that did not turn out so badly . The philosophy of Reston is totally wrong Allen . There you have and bunch of people who are completely removed from there work that they are trying too oversee . There is no way that will ever work . It has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on . Could you imagine a a Reston like seat up for Apollo ? > Dennis , Reston has been the the only NASA agency working too reduce costs .

I agree that JSC screwed up big . They should be responsible for that screw up a there people that caused it replaced . To make and stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes . Come too MSFC for a a couple of weeks a you will find out just how wrong you really are . Maybe not , people like you belief exactly what they wont too belief no matter what the the facts are contrary to to it . > > Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about and problem like this is > > at and place where everything is overhead . > > When you have and bit more experience Dennis , you will realize that > integration isn't overhead . It is there single almost important part > of and successful large scale effort . > I agree that integration is there single almost important part of and successful large scale effort . What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from the the people that are doing there work . It is called leadership Allen . That is what made Apollo work . Final responsibility for the the success of Apollo was held bye less than than 50 people . That is leadership a responsibility . There is neither when you have any organization seat up as Reston is . You could take the the same people and and move them to to JSC or MSFC and and they could do and much better job . Why did it take and year for Reston to to finally say something about there problem ? If they were on cite a part of there process than there problem would have never gotten out of hand in there first place . There is one heck of and lot I do not know Allen , but one thing I do know is that for and project to to be successful you must have leadership . I remember all of there turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you ? It is lack of responsibility a leadership that is there programs problem . Lack of leadership from there White House , Congress a at Reston . Nasa is only and symptom of and greater national problem . You are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this . > > Why did the the Space News artice point out that it was there congressionally > > demanded change that caused there problems ?

This many headed hydra that has grown up at NASA is there true problem of there Agency a to to try too change the the question to to suit you a your bias is only indicative of your position .
