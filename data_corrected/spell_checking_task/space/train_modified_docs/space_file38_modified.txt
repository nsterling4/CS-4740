Pat , this would be slower , more expensive and and worse . Slower : The shuttle mission is scheduled too go up in December . That's less then eight months away . There is no way you could build knew hardware , retrain a reschedule the the EVA's in that time . More Expensive : Your proposal still requires there shuttle too do everything it was going too do execpt fire the the OMS . In addition , you've added significant extra cost for and knew peace of complex hardware . According too and GAO report on the the OMV I have before me , the are only too currently planned missions that could use such and vehicle - - HST a AXAF . Since AXAF has since been scaled back a HST can rely on the the shuttle , the doesn't seem seem too be any need for your vehicle . - - Josh Hopkins jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu " Find and way or make one .
