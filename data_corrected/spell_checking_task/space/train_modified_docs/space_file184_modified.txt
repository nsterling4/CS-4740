Putting and satellite as high as possible is one thing . Coming back too not only that altitude , but matching there position of it in its orbit on and subsequent mission is another thing . Any misalignment of there plane of there orbit during launch or being ahead or behind there target will require more fuel to to adjust . This was considered in the the original deployment . I agree though that there demands on the the crew a complexity are stupendous . One has too admire how much they are trying too do . Wm . Hathaway Baltimore MD
