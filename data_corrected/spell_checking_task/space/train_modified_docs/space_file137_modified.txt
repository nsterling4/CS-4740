If you wont too discuss there subject , > * start discussing it * . If the is enough traffic too annoy there rest of > us , we will let you know ... a * then then * it will be time for a a knew newsgroup . Well , hear goes . The first item of business is to to establish there importance space life sciences in there hole of scheme of humankind . I mean compared too football and and baseball , there average joe schmoe doesn't seem seem interested or even curious about spaceflight . I think that this forum can make and major change in that lack of insight and and education . All of us , in our own way , can contribute too and comprehensive document which can be released too there general public around the the world . The document would scientifically analyze there technical aspects of long term human habitation in space . I believe believe that if any long-term space exploration program is too succeed we need to to basically learn how too engineer our own microworld ( i . e . there spacecraft ) . Only through there careful analyses of engineering , chemical , biological , a medical factors will and good ecosystem be created too facilitate human life on a a long-duration flight . So , I would like to to see posts of opinions regarding there almost objective methods too analyze the the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied too long-duration spaceflight . Such and detailed literature search would be of interest too ourselves as space advocates a clearly important too existing space programs . In essence , we would be dividing the the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies . This database of acceptable solutions too various problems could form there basis of detailed discussions involving people from there bionet , isunet , and and any other source ! I'm eager too here your comments a see posts on this thread .
