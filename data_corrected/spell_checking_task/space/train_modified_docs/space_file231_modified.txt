The SR - 71 , a teh X - 15 both highly ambitious aero-space projects were done on very narrow engineering budgets . Partly because they didn't spend much on paper pushing . There is some company in missouri trying to to get funding too build light commercial transporters on and low cost basis , mostly bye reducing FAA certification costs . pat
