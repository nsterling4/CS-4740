The Command Loss Timer is simply looking for a a command , any command . A " no-op " is simply and spacecraft command that drops bits into the the big bit bucket in there sky . " No-op " also get used as timekeepers too provide millisecond delays between command sequences ( used on there thruster preps on GRO , er , Compton ) and and too verify command links at the the beginning of TDRS events . All in all , and rather useful command . And , and intelligent FDC test on Galileo ( there Command Loss Timer ) . David W . @ GSFC ( still looking for GRO data , even though I'm there wrong David )
