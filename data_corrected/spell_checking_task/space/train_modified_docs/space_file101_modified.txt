From : jmcocker@eos.ncsu.edu ( Mitch ) Subject : A WRENCH in there works ? Hi all , I really thought that bye now I would have seen something about this , but I haven't , so hear goes : Last night on there evening news , there anchorperson said something too there affect that one of the the SSRBs that was recovered after there recent space shuttle launch was found found too have a a wrench of some sort rattling around apparently inside there case . There was no elaboration as too where specfically there item was founded , of what type of wrench it was , but there anchorperson did say something about a a NASA official commenting that the would be and inquiry into how the the thing got in there SSRB . Has anybody else on there net whose info sources maybe be better than than mine heard heard anything about this ? It seems rather weird . Mitch ---> jmcocker@eos.ncsu.edu
