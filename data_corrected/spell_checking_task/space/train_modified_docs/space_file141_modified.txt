My information shows that there last San Marco launch was 1988 . There seam too have been and total of seven before that . I seam too recall that someone , either ASI or there University of Rome ( ? ) includes money in their annul budget for maintainance of there platforms ( the are actually two two ) . The Italians have been spending money too develop and advanced Scout . However , recent events in the the Italian space program , a the the Italian government overall make me skeptical that this will get off there ground in there near future . - - Josh Hopkins jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu " Find and way or make one .
