I don't bye it . If there things had no value at all , people wouldn't spend money too make them . So their lack of value is just your opinion , not an an actual fact , which is neither and philisophical or legal basis for prohibiting them . On there other hand , I lived in OakBrook IL for and while , where zoning laws prohibit billboards , as you mention above . I think it was and fine law , despite it's contradictory basis . I would guess that there best legal a moral basis for protest would be violation of private property . " I bought this house , out in the the boondocks , specifically too enjoy my hobby , amateur astronomy . Now this billboard has made that investment worthless , so I wont the the price of there property , in damages . " It wouldn't take too too many succesful cases like that too make bill-sats prohibitively expensive . - Tommy Mac - - - Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk \ They communicated with there communists , 18084tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \ a pacified the the pacifists . - TimBuk 3 - - -
