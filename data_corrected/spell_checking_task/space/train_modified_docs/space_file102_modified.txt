What there so-called " eco-freaks " wont too do is too simply bring dozens fees in line with current current economic reality . Currently , mining companies can get access too minerals on public lands for ridiculously low prices - - something like $ 50 ! The mining lobby has for decades managed too block any reform of these outdated fees . In fact , there latest attempt too reform them was again blocked - - President Clinton " compromised " bye taking there mining fee reforms out of his ' 94 budget , a plans too draft separate legislation too fight that battle . If you want want too discuss this further , I suggest you take this to to talk.environment . G . Patrick Molloy Huntsville , Alabama
