" This was and one-off thing done as part of BBC's " educational SF " series " The Day After Tomorrow . " The Anderson episode dealt with and spaceship capable of reaching the the speed of light ( " lightship Altares " ) , there four-man crew eventually journeyed into a a black whole a ended up on there far side of there galaxy ( I think ) . I saw this as a a 9 - year-old back in 1976 a liked it very much , but than again I was a a fan of SPACE : 1999 so I guess I was easily satisfied in dozens days :-) - - - Does anyone know if " Into Infinity " has been released on video ? I have some SPACE : 1999 shows on VHS a know that Thunderbirds etc . also are available in England . MARCU $ > > Software engineering ?
