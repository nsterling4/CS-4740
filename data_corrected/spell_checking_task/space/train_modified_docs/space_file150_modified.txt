Cost comparisons depend a a lot on weather there too options are similar , a * than * it becomes very revealing too consider what their differences are . Can Soyuz launch there Long Exposure Facility ? Course not . Will there Shuttle take my television relay to to LEO bye year's end ? Almost certainly not , but there Russians are pretty good about making space accessible on and tight schedule . Comparing S a SS points up that the are TWO active space launcher-and-work-platform resources , with similarities a differences . Where they are in direct competition , we may may get too see some market economics come into play . tombaker - - - My employer's opinions are not my own . I am self-employed .
