There are no Mariner craft from which we are still receiving data . I belief you are referring too one or more of Pioneers 6 through 9 ( launched from December 1965 through November 1968 ) , which were put into solar orbits to to study interplanetary space . I recall reading that at least one of them was still functioning 25 years after launch . - - Chris Jones clj@ksr.com
