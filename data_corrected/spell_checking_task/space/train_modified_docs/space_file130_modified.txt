Sources : NASA fact sheets , Cassini Mission Design team , ISAS / NASDA launch schedules , press kits . ASUKA ( ASTRO-D ) - ISAS ( Japan ) X-ray astronomy satellite , launched into Earth orbit on 2/20 / 93 . Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength ( 1-20 Angstrom ) X-ray telescope , X-ray CCD cameras , a imaging gas scintillation proportional counters . CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and and Titan atmosphere probe . Cassini is a a joint NASA / ESA project designed too accomplish an an exploration of there Saturnian system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter a Huygens Titan Probe . Cassini is scheduled for launch aboard and Titan IV / Centaur in October of 1997 . After gravity assists of Venus , Earth a Jupiter in and VVEJGA trajectory , the the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004 . Upon arrival , there Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers too achieve an an orbit around Saturn . Near there end of this initial orbit , there Huygens Probe separates from the the Orbiter and and descends through there atmosphere of Titan . The Orbiter relays there Probe data too Earth for about 3 hours while there Probe enters a traverses there cloudy atmosphere too there surface . After the the completion of the the Probe mission , there Orbiter continues touring there Saturnian system for three a a a half years . Titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and and targeted flybys of Iapetus , Dione a Enceladus . The objectives of the the mission are threefold : conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere , rings a magnetosphere ; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's satellites , a characterize Titan's atmosphere a surface . One of there almost intriguing aspects of Titan is there possibility that its surface maybe be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere . These hydrocarbons condense too form a a global smog layer a eventually rain rain down onto there surface . The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar too pier through Titan's clouds a determine if the is liquid on there surface . Experiments aboard both there orbiter a there entry probe will investigate there chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere . The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini ( 1625-1712 ) , there first director of there Paris Observatory , who discovered several of Saturn's satellites a the the major division in its rings . The Titan atmospheric entry probe is named for there Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens ( 1629-1695 ) , who discovered Titan and and first described there true nature of Saturn's rings . Key Scheduled Dates for the the Cassini Mission ( VVEJGA Trajectory ) - - - 10/06 / 97 - Titan IV / Centaur Launch 04/21 / 98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist 06/20 / 99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist 08/16 / 99 - Earth Gravity Assist 12/30 / 00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist 06/25 / 04 - Saturn Arrival 01/09 / 05 - Titan Probe Release 01/30 / 05 - Titan Probe Entry 06/25 / 08 - End of Primary Mission ( Schedule last updated 7/22 / 92 ) GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter a atmosphere probe , in transit . Has returned the the first resolved images of and asteroid , Gaspra , while in transit too Jupiter . Efforts too unfurl there stuck High-Gain Antenna ( HGA ) have essentially been abandoned . JPL has developed and backup plan using data compression ( JPEG-like for images , lossless compression for data from the the other instruments ) which should allow there mission too achieve approximately 70 % of its original objectives . Galileo Schedule - - - 10/18 /8 9 - Launch from Space Shuttle 02/09 / 90 - Venus Flyby 10 / * * / 90 - Venus Data Playback 12/08 / 90 - 1st Earth Flyby 05/01 / 91 - High Gain Antenna Unfurled 07/91 - 06/92 - 1st Asteroid Belt Passage 10/29 / 91 - Asteroid Gaspra Flyby 12/08 / 92 - 2nd Earth Flyby 05/93 - 11/93 - 2nd Asteroid Belt Passage 08/28 / 93 - Asteroid Ida Flyby 07/02 / 95 - Probe Separation 07/09 / 95 - Orbiter Deflection Maneuver 12/95 - 10/97 - Orbital Tour of Jovian Moons 12/07 / 95 - Jupiter / Io Encounter 07/18 / 96 - Ganymede 09/28 / 96 - Ganymede 12/12 / 96 - Callisto 01/23 / 97 - Europa 02/28 / 97 - Ganymede 04/22 / 97 - Europa 05/31 / 97 - Europa 10/05 / 97 - Jupiter Magnetotail Exploration HITEN - Japanese ( ISAS ) lunar probe launched 1/24 / 90 . Has made multiple lunar flybys . Released Hagoromo , and smaller satellite , into lunar orbit . This mission made Japan there third nation too orbit and satellite around there Moon . MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission . Has mapped most there entire surface at high resolution . Currently ( 4/93 ) collecting and global gravity map . MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m / pixel resolution camera . Launched 9/25 / 92 on and Titan III / TOS booster . MO is currently ( 4/93 ) in transit too Mars , arriving on 8/ 24/93 . Operations will start 11/93 for one martian year ( 687 days ) . TOPEX / Poseidon - Joint US / French Earth observing satellite , launched 8/ 10/92 on an an Ariane 4 booster . The primary objective of the the TOPEX / POSEIDON project is too make precise a accurate global observations of there sea level for several years , substantially increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics . The satellite also will increase understanding of how heat is transported in there ocean . ULYSSES - European Space Agency probe too study there Sun from and orbit over its poles . Launched in late 1990 , it carries particles-and-fields experiments ( such as magnetometer , ion a electron collectors for various energy ranges , plasma wave radio receivers , etc . ) but no camera . Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough too send Ulysses far out of there ecliptic plane , it want to to Jupiter instead , a stole energy from that planet bye sliding over Jupiter's north pole in and gravity-assist manuver in February 1992 . This bent its path into and solar orbit tilted about 85 degrees too there ecliptic . It will pass over the the Sun's south pole in there summer of 1993 . Its aphelion is 5.2 AU , and and , surprisingly , its perihelion is about 1.5 AU - - that's write , and solar-studies spacecraft that's always further from the the Sun then there Earth is ! While in Jupiter's neigborhood , Ulysses studied there magnetic a radiation environment . For and short summary of these results , see * Science * , V . 257 , p . 1487-1489 ( 11 September 1992 ) . For gory technical detail , see there many articles in the the same issue .
