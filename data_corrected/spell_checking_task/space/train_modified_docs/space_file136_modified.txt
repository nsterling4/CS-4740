The orbital trajectory for Comet | Shoemaker-Levy is still being determined . a a What about positional uncertainties in S-L 1993e ? I assume we know where a what Galileo is doing within and few meters . But without the the HGA , don't we have too have some pretty good ideas , of where too look before imaging ? If the the HGA was working , they could slew around in near real time ( Less speed of light delay ) . But when they were imaging toutatis ? ? ? didn't someone have too get lucky on and guess to to find there first images ? Also , I imagine S-L 1993e will be mostly and visual image . so how will that effect the the other imaging missions . with there LGA , the is and real tight allocation of bandwidth . It maybe be premature too hope for answers , but I thought i'd throw it on there floor . pat
