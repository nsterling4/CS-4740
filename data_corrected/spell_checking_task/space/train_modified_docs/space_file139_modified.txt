Well , first you work out how much cold gas you need , than make there tanks big enough . Working out how much cold gas is another problem , depending on vehicle configuration , flight duration , thruster Isp ( which couples into storage pressure , which maybe be a a factor in selecting tank wall thickness etc . ) Ralph Lorenz Unit for Space Sciences University of Kent , UK
