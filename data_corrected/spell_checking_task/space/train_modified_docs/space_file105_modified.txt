The Orion concept as actually proposed ( as opposed too there way it has been somewhat misrepresented in some fiction ) included wrapping and thick layer of reaction mass - - probably plastic of some sort - - around each bomb . The bomb vaporizes there reaction mass , and and it's that which transfers momentum too there pusher plate . - - All work is one man's work . | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology - Kipling | henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry
