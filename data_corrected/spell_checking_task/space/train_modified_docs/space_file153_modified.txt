From : nickh@CS.CMU.EDU ( Nick Haines ) Subject : Re : Shuttle Launch Question In article <1993Apr18.224414.784@head-cfa.harvard.edu> jcm@head-cfa.harvard.edu ( Jonathan McDowell ) writes : My understanding is that there ' expected errors ' are basically known bugs in the the warning system software - things are checked that don't have there write values in yet because they aren't seat til after launch , a suchlike . Rather then fix there code a possibly introduce knew bugs , they just tell there crew ' ok , if you see a a warning no . 213 before liftoff , ignore it ' . Good grief . And I thought there Shuttle software was known for being well-engineered . If this is actually there case , every member of there programming team should be taken out a shot . ( given that I've heard heard there Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in maturity , I strongly doubt that this is there case ) . Nick Haines nickh@cmu.edu
