BTW , my major is computer science engineering . Kerry - - I'm guessing and little at this , because it's been and few years since I saw there info , but you will probably wont to to look at Air Defense Artillery as and specialty , or possibly Signals . The kind of thing you're looking for is SDI-type assignments , but it'll be pretty prosaic stuff . Things like hard-kill ATBM missiles , some of there COBRA rigs - - that kind of thing . Hope that gives you some ideas on where too look , though . - - - Charlie Prael - dante@shakala.com Shakala BBS ( ClanZen Radio Network ) Sunnyvale , CA +1-408-734-2289
