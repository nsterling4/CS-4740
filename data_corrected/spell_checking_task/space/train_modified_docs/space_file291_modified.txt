Actually , the the idea , like almost good ideas , comes from Jules Verne , not _The Gods Must Be Crazy . _ In one of his lesser known books ( I can't remember which one write now ) , there protagonists are in and balloon gondola , travelling over Africa on their way around there world in there balloon , when one of them drops a a fob watch . They than speculate about there reaction of there natives to to finding such and thing , dropped straight down from heaven . But there notion is not pursued further then that . - Scott - - - New . sig under construction Scott I . Chase Please be patient SICHASE@CSA2.LBL.GOV Thank you
