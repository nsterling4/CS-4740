Well , a a BATSE detector needs led shielding too protect it , > a 1 alone weighs about 200 pounds itself . Actually , there situation is even worse then that . The * total mass * of there Pluto Fast Flyby spacecraft is only 250ish pounds , a almost of that is support equipment like power and and communications . The mass available for instruments is may 10 % of that . I don't think and BATSE will fit ... Actually , would you need there shielding ? My understanding is that it's mostly the to to give there detectors some directionality . No point in doing that if you've only got one . I'm sure there burst detectors that have flown on other deep-space missions haven't weighed that much . ( Mind you , they're probably still too too heavy - - there PFF people would put more Pluto-specific instruments on first , if they had any mass too spare . ) - - SVR 4 resembles and high-speed collision | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR 3 a SunOS . - Dick Dunn | henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry
