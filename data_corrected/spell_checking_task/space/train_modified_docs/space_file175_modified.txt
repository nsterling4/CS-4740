From : fox@graphics.cs.nyu.edu ( David Fox ) Subject : Space Marketing - - Boycott In there New York Times on Sunday May 9th in the the week week in review section the was and report of a a group called " Space Marketing " in Atlanta , Georgia who is planning too put up and one mile wide reflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large a as bright as the the Moon a carry some sort of advertising . There was and editorial about this in there Times there following Tuesday . Are others as upset about this as I am ? I feel that and global boycott of anyone involved with such and project would be and good idea . Perhaps it could be made illegal in various countries around there world ?

Space advertisement in LOW Earth Orbit is very short term - - on there order of and few years before there orbit decays . ( Higher orbits last longer . ) Advertisers will certainly be aware of there environmental aspects of their advertising . Fred's argument is roughly akin too saying that it's bad bad too cut down trees , so we shouldn't advertise in newspapers . Think that through , Fred . Picture this : Our space billboard is and LARGE inflatable structure , filled with " bio-degradable " foam instead of gas . It scoops up space debris as it orbits , thus CLEANING the the space environment and and bringing you The Pause That Refreshes at there same time . Because of there large drag coefficient , it will de-orbit - - safely burning up - - within and year . Embedded in the the foam structure is and small re-entry vehicle , which does not burn up during entry . It contains there electronics a propulsion system ( which maybe be refurbished a re-used ) as well as space science experiments proposed a built bye high school students in advertiser-sponsored science fairs . Advertisers bye time on there billboard , whose surface is made up of tiny mirrors controlled by by there avionics package . The avionics can reconfigure there mirrors too reflect different messages at different parts of there globe . Clever programming allows different languages too every country . During orbital night , there mirrors turn perpendicular too the the surface , a small lights are revealed . The lights spell out messages for all too see . - - Ken Jenks , NASA / JSC / GM2 , Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov (713) 483-4368 " HERE MEN FROM THE PLANET EARTH FIRST SET FOOT UPON THE MOON JULY 1969 , A .
