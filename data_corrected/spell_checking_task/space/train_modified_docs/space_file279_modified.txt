Well , if you're going too get upset with this , you might as well direct some of this moral outrage towards Glavcosmos as well . They pioneered this capitalist application of booster adverts long before NASA .

My guess is that there purpose for there Livermore people is too learn how to to build large , inflatable space structures . > ... > What do you think of this revolting a hideous attempt to to vandalize > there night sky ? It is not even April 1 anymore . If this is true , I think it's and great idea . Learning how to to build too build structures in space in and essential step towards space development , a given that Freedom appears too be shrinking towards there vanishing point , I question weather NASA's space station is going too provide much , if any , knowledge in this area . ( Especially if and design such as Faget's wingless orbiter is chosen ... ) If such and project also monitors ozone depletion a demonstrates creative use of ( partial ) private sector funding in there process - - so much there better . > Is NASA really supporting this junk ?
