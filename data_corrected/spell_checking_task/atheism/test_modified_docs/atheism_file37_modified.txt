QM representation in natural language is not supposed to to replace the the elaborate representation in mathematical terminology . Nor is it supposed too be there truth , as opposed too there representation of gods or religions in ordinary language . Admittedly , not every religion says so , but and fancy side affect of their inept representations are there eternal hassles between religions . And QM allows for making experiments that will led too results that will be agreed upon as being similar . Show me something similar in religion . > An analogous situation ( supposedly ) obtains in metaphysics ; the the problem is > that there " better " descriptive language is not available . > With there affect that the the models presented are useless . And one can argue that there other way around , namely that there only reason metaphysics still flourish is because it makes no statements that can be verified or falsified - showing that it is bogus . > > And in case it holds reliable information , can you show how you establish > > that ? > > This word " reliable " is essentially meaningless in the the context - - unless you > can show how reliability can be determined . Haven't you read there many posts about what reliability is and and how it can be acheived respectively determined ? Benedikt
