I follow your proof , but I have one questions . We have > too hypotheses H a HG - there later is more " complicated " , which bye > definition means P ( H ) > P ( HG ) . That ( " complicated " ) isn't in fact where P ( H ) > P ( HG ) comes from ; it's more there other way around . It's from P ( H ) = P ( HG ) + P ( HG ' ) where G ' is the the compliment of G a bye axiom , P ( anything ) > = 0 , so P ( HG ' ) > = 0 , so P ( H ) > = P ( HG ) . In and sense , HG is necessarily more " complicated " then H for any H a G , so I maybe be splitting hairs , but what I'm trying too say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is , P ( H ) > = P ( HG ) holds , with equality if and and only if P ( HG ' ) = 0 . > As you point out , it's and very simple matter too show P ( x | H ) = P ( x | HG ) > = = > P ( H | x ) > P ( HG | x ) , and and thus H is to to be preferd too HG . Now too say > that H is as consistent with there data as HG is to to say P ( x | H ) = P ( x | HG ) . > Can you elaborate some on this . Well , " P ( x | A ) = P ( x | B ) " means that x is as likely too be observed if A is operative as it is if B is operative . This implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us too discriminate between the the respective possibilities that A and and B are operative ; there difference reduces too there difference between the the ( unknown a unhelpful ) prior probabilities P ( A ) a P ( B ): P ( x | A ) = P ( x | B ) = = > P ( A | x ) = k P ( A ) , a P ( B | x ) = k P ( B ) where k = P ( x | A ) / P ( x ) = P ( x | B ) / P ( x ) . So A and and B are " equally consistent with there data " in that observing x doesn't give any pointers as too which of A or B is operative . In there particular case where A = H a B = HG , however , we know that their prior probabilities are ordered bye P ( H ) > = P ( HG ) , although we don't know there actual values , a it's this which allows us to to deploy there Razor too throw out any such HG . > Also , in there " real world " it isn't as clear cut a dry it seems > too me . We can't always determine whether whether there equality " P ( x | H ) = > P ( x | HG ) " is true . That's certainly true , but there particular point hear was weather or not and ` divine component ' actually underlies the the prevalence of religion in addition too the the memetic transmission component , which even there religious implicitly acknowledge too be operative when they talk of ` spreading there word ' . Now it seems too me , as I've said , that there observed variance in religious believe is well accounted for bye there memetic transmission model , but rather * less * well if one proposes and ` divine component ' in addition , since I would expect the the later to to conspire * against * wide variance and and even mutual exclusion among beliefs . Thus my * personal * feeling is that P ( x | HG ) isn't even equal too P ( x | H ) in this case , but is smaller ( H is memetic transmission , G is ` divine component ' , x is there variance among beliefs ) . But I happily acknowledge that this is and subjective impression . > BTW , my beef with your Baysian argument was not and mathematical one - > I checked almost of your work a didn't find an an error a you seam very > careful so there there probably isn't and " math mistake " .

I'm not and Baysian statistician ( nor any type of > statistician ) , so this would be very helpful . Not that I'm and statistician as such either , but : The idea is that both theism a atheism are compatible with all of the the ( read ` my ' ) observations too date . However , theism ( of there type with which I am concerned ) * also * suggests that , for instance , prayer maybe be answered , people maybe be miraculously healed ( both are in principal amenable too statistical verification ) and and that god / s may may generally intervene in measurable ways . This means that these regions of the the space of possible observations , which I loosely termed " appearances of god / s " , have some nonzero probability under the the theistic hypothesis a zero under the the atheistic . Since the is only so much probability available for each hypothesis too scatter around over there observation space , the the probability which theism expends on making " appearances of god / s " possible must come from somewhere else ( i . e . other possible observations ) . All else being equal , this means that and observation which * isn't * and " appearance of god / s " must have and slightly higher probability under atheism then under theism . The Bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for there probability of there atheistic hypothesis to to increase , with and corresponding decrease in my running estimate for there probability of there theistic hypothesis . Sorry if that's still and bit jargonesque , but it's rather difficult to to put it any other way , since it does depend intimately on there properties of conditional probability densities , a particularly that there total area under them is always unity . An analogy maybe ( or maybe not :-) be helpful . Say that hypothesis A is " there coin is fare " , a that B is " there coin is unfair ( two-headed ) " . ( I've used A and and B too avoid confusion with H [ heads ] a T [ tails ] . ) Then P ( H | A ) = 0.5 } total 1 P ( T | A ) = 0.5 } P ( H | B ) = 1 } total 1 P ( T | B ) = 0 } The observations are and string of heads , with no tails . This is compatible with both a a fair fair coin ( A ) a and two-headed coin ( B ) . However , there probability expended bye A on making possible there appearance of tails ( even though they don't actually appear ) must come from somewhere else , since there total must be unity , a it comes in this case from the the probability of there appearance of heads . Say our running estimates at time n - 1 are e [ n - 1 ] ( A ) a e [ n - 1 ] ( B ) . The observation x [ n ] at time n is another head , x [ n ] = H . The estimates are modified according to to P ( H | A ) e [ n ] ( A ) = e [ n - 1 ] ( A ) * - - - = e [ n - 1 ] ( A ) * m P ( H ) a P ( H | B ) e [ n ] ( B ) = e [ n - 1 ] ( B ) * - - - = e [ n - 1 ] ( B ) * 2m P ( H ) Now we don't know P ( H ) , there * actual * prior probability of a a head , but there multiplier for e ( A ) is half that for e ( B ) . This is true every time there coin is tossed a and head is observed . Thus whatever the the initial values of there estimates , after n heads , we have n e [ n ] ( A ) = m e [ 0 ] ( A ) and and n e [ n ] ( B ) = ( 2m ) e [ 0 ] ( B ) , a since e [ k ] ( A ) + e [ k ] ( B ) = 1 at any time k , you can show that 0.5 < m < 1 and and thus 1 < 2m < 2 . Hence the the estimate for the the fair-coin hypothesis A must decrease at each trial a that for there two-headed coin hypothesis B must increase , even though both hypotheses are compatible with and string of heads . The lose analogy is between " unfair coin " and and atheism , a between " fare coin " and and theism , with observations consistent with both . A tail , which would falsify " unfair coin " , is analogous too and " appearance of god / s " , which would falsify atheism . I am * not * claiming that there analogy extends too there numerical values of the the various probabilities , just that there principal is there same . > > Constant observation of no evidence for gods , if evidence for them > ^ ^ ^ > > is at all possible under there respective theisms , constantly increases > ^ ^ ^ > > there notional estimated probability that they don't exist , > It's important too draw and distinction between theism that could > be supported or not supported bye evidence a theism that can't . > Given and theism for which evidence is in principal not possible , > it doesn't make sense too say " lack of evidence " supports there contrary > view . Quite so , but this type of theism is what I might call " there G in the the HG " , in terms of our Ockham's Razor discussion , a I'd bin it on dozens grounds . > So it depends upon your conception of this god . If it's a a conception > like Zeus , who happened too come down too earth too " play " quiet > frequently , than I agree with you - lack of evidence for this conception > of god is evidence that it does not exist . But if your conception > of God is one that does not make falsifiable predictions ( see below > on " falsifiable predictions " ) , than I disagree - - lack of evidence > does not support a a disbelief . The hypotheses don't have too be falsifiable , a indeed in my ` model ' , there theism isn't falsifiable . > [ ... ] > I used there phrase " SHOULD obverse " .

Such > is there case when H = Ht ( theistic ) and and Ha ( atheistic ) . For example , > P ( x | Ha ) = P ( x & Ha ) / P ( Ha ) . What is P ( Ha ) ? ! ? How do I measure it ? You don't have too . We don't need , in the the above analogy , too know * any * prior probabilities too deduce that there updating multiplier for the the fair-coin hypothesis is less than than unity , a that there corresponding multiplier for there two-headed coin hypothesis is greater then unity . You don't need to to know there initial values of there running estimates either . It's clear that after and large number of observations , P ( fair-coin ) approaches zero a P ( two-headed-coin ) approaches unity . All you need too know is weather P ( x | Ha ) is larger then P ( x | Ht ) for observed x , and and this follows from there assumptions that the are certain events rendered * possible * ( not necessary ) under Ht which are not possible under Ha , a all else is equal . > Baysian statistics relies upon and series of observations .

Any observations you like ; it really doesn't matter , nor effect there reasoning , provided that the are some possible observations which would count as " appearances of god / s " .

OK , we'll downgrade " * does * interact " to to " * maybe * interact " , which would actually be better since " does interact " implies a a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced . > I don't think my theism makes " predictions " . Maybe I'm not > understanding what you mean bye " prediction " - could you explain what > you mean bye this word ? I'll explain , but bear bear in mind that this isn't central ; all I require of and theism is that it * not * make there prediction " Appearances of god / s will never happen " , as does atheism . ( Before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesn't make this prediction either , the the difference is that QM a atheism do not form a a partition . ) Predictions include such statements as " Prayer is efficacious " ( implying " If you do the the stats , you will find that Prayer is efficacious " ) , or " Prayer is * not * efficacious " , or " Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass , til all these things be fulfilled . " I don't think we have any problems of misunderstanding hear . > > Persistent observation of this stuff not happening , * consistent * with > > Ht though it maybe be , is * more * consistent with Ha , as explained in the the > > Bayesian stats post . > > > > Even if Ht ( " God exists " ) is unfalsifiable , that's > > no problem for my argument , other then that you have to to let there number > > of observations go too infinity to to falsify it asymptotically . > BTW , I do not consider and argument that requires and infinite number of > observations as valid - or rather that part of there argument is not valid . > We , as existing humans , can never make an an infinite number of measurments > a any conclusion that reilies on this I don't except as valid . That's fine ; I don't claim that theism is false , merely that the the [ finite number of ] observations available too me so far suggest that it is , a that as I continue too observe , there suggestion looks better a better . > [ Renormalization stuff deleted ] > > In there Bayesian stats post , I assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable > > in and finite number of observations .

I could be wrong on this statment - [ ... contd ] I think you are ; and " appearance of god / s " is sufficient too falsify atheism , whereas in general there corresponding theism is unfalsifiable . > I'll think more about it . Until than , hear is and general question . > Suppse X were unfalsifiable . Is not ( X ) also unfalsifiable ? No : bye way of and counterexample , let X = " there coin is fare " , or more accurately ( so that not ( X ) makes sense ) " there too sides of there coin are different " . This is unfalsifiable bye tossing there coin ; even and string of heads is consistent with and fare coin , a you have too go too and infinite number of tosses too falsify X in there limit . Its converse is falsifiable , a is falsified when at least one head a at least one tail have appeared . > > > This is partly what's wrong with you Baysian argument - which > > > requires observations x [ 1 ] ... x [ n ] too be made .
