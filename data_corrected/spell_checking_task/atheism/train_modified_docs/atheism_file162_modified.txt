What I've been saying is that moral behavior is likely there null behavior . That is , it doesn't take much work too be moral , but it certainly does too be amoral ( in some cases ) .

Our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in there animal kingdom . > > So you are basically saying that you think and " moral " is and undefinable > > term , and and that " moral systems " don't exist ?
