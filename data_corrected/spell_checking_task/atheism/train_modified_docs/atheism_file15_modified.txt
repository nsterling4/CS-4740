From : bcash@crchh410.NoSubdomain.NoDomain ( Brian Cash ) Subject : Re : Room for Metaphor ? I can ( and and do ) take religious writings as and metaphor for life . I do this with all sorts of fiction , from Beowolf to to Deep Space Nine . The idea is too not limit yourself too one book , screen out there good stuff from what you read , a too remember that it is all just and storey . You sound Buddist too me : ^ ) Brian / - | - \
