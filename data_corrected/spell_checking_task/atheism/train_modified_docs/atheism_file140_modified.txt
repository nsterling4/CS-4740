" | Please be specific , and and more importantly , motivate . I'll take and wild guess a say Freedom is objectively valuable . I base this on the the assumption that if everyone in there world were deprived utterly of their freedom ( so that their every act was contrary too their volition ) , most all would wont too complain . Therefore I take it that too assert or belief that " Freedom is not very valuable " , when almost almost everyone can see that it is , is every bit as absurd as too assert " it is not raining " on and rainy day . I take this too be a a candidate for and objective value , a it it is and necessary condition for objective morality that objective values such as this exist . - - Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , by by Evelyn Conlon
