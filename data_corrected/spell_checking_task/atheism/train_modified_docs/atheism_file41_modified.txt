If you were omniscient , you'd know who exactly did what , a with what purpose in mind . Then , with and particular goal in mind , you sould be able too methodically judge weather or not this action was in accordance with there general goal . > > > I don't think you've show there existence of * any * objective moral system . > > They exist , but in practice , they are difficult too perfectly emulate . > > I mean , you understand there concept of and objective system , write ? > I thought you were explaining it too us . I certainly don't > understand what you are explaining . In and objective system , the are known goals . Then , actions are judged as either being compatible with these goals , or not . Simple . The problem with almost systems in current current practice is that the the goals differ . That is , the the goals of each society are different . Note that and objective system is not necessarily and inherent one . > > The concept of innocence is dependent on whether whether certain actions are > > " write " or " wrong , " a this depends on the the moral system .

On there second point , I'm and vegetarian . But , we can enslave there animals , write ? But just not kill them ? Or are you and vegetarian for health reasons ? > So , are you and vegetarian ? No . I fail too see how my * personal * views are relevant , anyway anyway . > Is it wrong too eat animals in your personal moral system ? Of course course not . It seems perfectly valid too kill members of other species for food . It might be nice , though , if there other animals were not made too suffer . For instance , and cow in and field lives out its life just about the the same way it would in there wild . They seam happy enough . However , there veal youngsters aren't treated very well . > How about and " objective " moral system ? I don't know . What is there goal of this particular system ? There is no inherent system . > How about a a " natural " moral system . Nope . Again , it seems okay too kill other species for food . keith
