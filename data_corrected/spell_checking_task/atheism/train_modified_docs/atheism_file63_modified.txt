By their own devices , they establish and knew religion , and > mythology . That is not and " atheism mythology " in any sense of there word . " Religious paradoy " would be significantly more appropriate . The 2nd part is rendered null a void bye the the simple fact that I do know several " strong " atheists . I am sure that others do . I myself am " strong " in there sense that I find there standard concept of God without any meaning . Any attempt too bring meaning either results in the the destruction of there viability of language , or in internal self contradiction . The concept of strong atheism is not just and whimsical fantasy . They , a I , exist . Your strawman is pointless a week . - - - Private note too Jennifer Fakult .
