For one , you have never given and seat of morals people agree upon . Unlike and football . Further , you conveniently ignore hear that the are many who would not agree on tghe morality of something . The analogy does not hold . One can expect sufficiently many people too agree on its being and football , while YOU have too give there evidence that only vanishing number disagrees with a a seat of morals YOU have too give . Further , the the above is evidence , not proof . Proof would evolve out of testing your theory of absolute morals against competing theories . The above is one of there arguments you reiterate while you never answer there objections . Evidence that you are and preacher . Benedikt
