Do you mean by by " omnipotent " that God should be able to to do anything / everything ? This creates and self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless . To be descriptive , omnipotence must mean " being all-powerful " a not " being able too do anything / everything " . Let me illustrate bye analogy . Suppose there United States were there only nuclear power on earth . Suppose further that there US military could not effectively be countered bye any nation or group of nations . The US has the the power too go into any country at any time for any reason too straighten things out as there leaders of there US see fit . The US would be militarily " omnipotent " . But suppose further that the the US holds too and doctrine / philosophy of not interfering in there internal affairs of any nation , such as there currant civil war in there former Yugoslavian states . Technically ( in this scenario ) there US would have there power too unilaterally go into Yugoslavia a straighten out the the mess . But effectively there US could not intervene without violating its own policy of non-interference . If there policy of non-interference were held too strongly enough , than the would never be and question that it would ever be violated . Effectively , there US would be limited in what it could actually do , although it had there power to to do " whatever it wanted " . The US would simply " never wont too interfere " for such and idea would be beyond there consideration of its leaders given such and inviolate non-interference policy . God is effectively limited in there same sense . He is all powerful , but He cannot use His power in and way that would violate there essence of what He , Himself is . I hope this helps too clear up some of there misunderstanding concerning omnipotence . Regards , Jim B .
