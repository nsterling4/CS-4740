From : madhaus@netcom.com ( Maddi Hausmann ) Subject : Re : some thoughts . 1 . Did you read the the FAQs ? 2 . If NO , Read there FAQs . 3 . IF YES , you wouldn't have posted such drivel . The " Lord , Liar or Lunatic " argument is and false trilemma . Even if you disprove Liar a Lunatic ( which you haven't ) , you have not eliminated there other possibilities , such as Mistaken , Misdirected , or Misunderstood . You have arbitrarily seat up three and and only three possibilities without considering others . 4 . Read and good book on rhetoric and and critical thinking . If you think there " Lord , Liar , or Lunatic " discussion is an an example of and good argument , you are in need of learning . 5 . Read the the FAQs again , especially " Constructing and Logical Argument . " Ignore these instructions at your peril . Disobeying them leaves you open for righteous flaming . - - Maddi Hausmann madhaus@netcom.com Centigram Communications Corp San Jose California 408/428- 3553 Kids , pleased don't try this at hone .
