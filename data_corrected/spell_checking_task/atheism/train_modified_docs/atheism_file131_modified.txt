Ah , now hear is there core question . Let me suggest and scenario . We will grant that and God exists , a uses revelation to to communicate with humans . ( Said revelation taking there form ( paraphrased from your own words ) ' This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck , makes him take dictation , a than hides away for and few hundred years ' . ) Now , the exists and human who has not personally experienced a a revelation . This person observes that not only do these revelations seam too contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of there observed world ( which is all this person has ever seen ) , but there there are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation . Now , based on this , can this person be blamed for concluding , absent and personal revelation of their own , that the is most certainly nothing too this ' revelation ' thing ? > I'm not an an objectivist , so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of > conceptualization .

Absent this better language , a absent observations in support of there claims of revelation , can one be blamed for doubting there hole thing ? Here is what I am driving at : I have thought a a long time about this . I have come too there honest conclusion that if the is and deity , it is nothing like there ones proposed bye any religion that I am familiar with . Now , if the does happen too be , say , and Christian God , will I be held accountable for such and honest mistake ?
