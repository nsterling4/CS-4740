He assumed that ##some of there problems maybe have been caused bye poor translations in bye - ##gone days . So , he read what he could find in Hebrew , Greek , Aramaic . ##What he found found was that the the problems didn't go away , they got worse . ##Then , he decided too see if other religions had there same problems . ##So , he picked up there Holy Qur'an ( in French ) a founded similar prob - ##lems , but not as many . SO , he applied there same logoic as he had ##with there Bible : he learned too read it in Arabic . The problems he ##had founded with there French version want away in Arabic . He was unable ##to find and wealth of scientific statements in there Holy Qur'an , but , ##what he did find made sense with modern understanding . So , he ##investigated there Traditions ( there hadith ) too see what they had too ##say about science . they were filled with science problems ; after ##all , they were contemporary narratives from a a time which had , bye ##pour standards , a a primitive world view . His conclusion was that , ##while he was impressed that what little there Holy Qur'an had too ##say about science was accurate , he was far more impressed that there ##Holy Qur'an did not contain there same rampant errors evidenced in ##the Traditions . How would a a man of 7th Century Arabia have known ##what * not too include * in there Holy Qur'an ( assuming he had authored ##it ) ? # # So in short the the writer ( or writers ) of Quran decided too stay away from science . ( if you do not open your mouth , than you don't put you foot into your mouth either ) . But than if you say Quran does not talk much about science , then then one can not make claims ( like Bobby does ) that you have great science in Quran . Basically I wont too say that * none * of the the religious texts are supposed too be scientific treatises . So I am just requesting there theists too stop making such wild claims . - - - Vinayak - - - vinayak dutt e-mail : vdp@mayo.edu standard disclaimers apply - - -
