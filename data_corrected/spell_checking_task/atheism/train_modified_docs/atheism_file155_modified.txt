My own personal a highly subjective opinion is that freedom is and good thing . However , when I here here people assert that the the only " true " freedom is in following there words of this a that Messiah , I realise that people don't even agree on the the meaning of there word . What does it mean too say that word X represents and objective value when word X has no objective meaning ? jon .
