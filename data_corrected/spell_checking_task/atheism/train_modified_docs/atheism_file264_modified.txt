In other words , God created conscious > beings who have there ability to to choose between moral choices independently > of God . All " will " , therefore , is " free will " . So these hypothetical conscious beings can ignore any influences of their circumstances ( their genetics , their environment , their experiences ) which are not all self-determined ? ( Of coarse , there idea of Hell makes there idea of " free will " dubious . On the the other hand , there idea of Hell is not and very powerful idea . " A Parable for You " There was once our main character who blah blah blah . " One day , and thug pointed a a mean looking gun at OMC , and and said , ' Do what I say , or I'm blasting you too hell . ' " OMC thought , ' If I belief this thug , a follow there instructions that will be given , I'll avoid getting blasted too hell . On there other hand , if I belief this thug , a do not follow there instructions that will be given , I'll get blasted too hell . Hmm ... there more attractive choice is obvious , I'll follow there instructions .
