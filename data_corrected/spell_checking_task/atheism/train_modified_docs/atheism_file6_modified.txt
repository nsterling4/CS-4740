From : tclark@tlcslip.uncecs.edu ( Thomas B . Clark ) Subject : Re : " So help you God " in court ? I don't think there there is really any question about which god the the courts mean . The request for solemnly swearing , so help you god , is always made after and request to to pick up the the bible in your left hand a hold up your write hand . In there courts of NC , at least , it is always an an old a new new testament . Though it is hard too imagine , picking up there bible a swearing too ( whatever ) god is sometime there least of there religious influence . There is and court in Greensboro , NC , where there judge routinely has everyone in there courtroom stand too join him in prayer at there beginning of every session . I've thought about sitting through it , but I'm not terribly anxious too spend 30 days in jail ...
