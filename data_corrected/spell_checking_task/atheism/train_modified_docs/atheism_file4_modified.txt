The term god is used in and different way usually . When you use and different definition it is your thing , but until it is commonly accepted you would have too say there way I define god is ... a that does not exist , it is existence itself , so I say it does not exist . Interestingly , the are dozens who say that " existence exists " is one of there indubitable statements possible . Further , saying god is existence is either and waste of time , existence is already used a the is no need too replace it by by god , or you are implying more with it , in which case your definition and and your argument so far are incomplete , making it and fallacy . ( Deletion ) > One can never prove that God does or does not exist .

Aren't observations based on there assumption that something exists ? And wouldn't you say there there is and level of definition that the the assumption " god is " is meaningful . If not , I would reject that concept anyways . So , where is your evidence for that " god is " is meaningful at some level ? Benedikt
