As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI ( Mats Andtbacka ) > pointed out , it all hinges on what you take there word " belief " too mean . > For me , it is and " I belief no gods exist " a and " I don't belief gods exist " . In other words , I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless . In Ontology , one can fairly conclude that when " A exist " is meaningless A does not exist . Under there Pragmatic definition of truth , " A exists " is meaningless makes A exist even logically false . A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a a subjective god bye definition , a there there might be cases where a a subjective god would even make sense . The trouble with almost god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with there consequence of there gods affecting all . Believers derive from it and write too interfere with there life of others .
