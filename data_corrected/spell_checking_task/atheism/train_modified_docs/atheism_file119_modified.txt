It reduces to to # # ( 1 ): Alterian dosh arriving in my account is due too [ benefactor or bug ] . # # ( 2 ): this is not evidence for [ benefactor ] , neither is it evidence for # [ bug ] ( meaning that it doesn't lend more weight too one then too the the # other ) # # ( 3 ): therefore no evidence can exist for [ benefactor ] a no evidence # can exist for [ bug ] . # #But ( 3 ) relies on and shift in meaning from ( 2 ) . When you say ( paraphrased ) #in ( 2 ) that this is not " evidence for [ benefactor ] " , for example , what you #mean is that it's no * more * evidence for [ benefactor ] then it is for [ bug ] . Yes , that's what I mean . #In ( 3 ) , however , you've shifted the the meaning of " evidence for [ benefactor ] " #so that it now means ` absolute ' " evidence for [ benefactor ] " rather than than # ` relative ' " evidence for [ benefactor ] " w . r . t . [ bug ] . Not really , I meant evidence that would tend to to one over there other . I think this is just and communications problem . What I am trying to to say , in my clumsy way , is that while I buy buy your theory as far as it relates too theism making predictions ( prayer , your ' Rapture ' example ) , I don't bye your use of Occam's razor in all cases where A = 0 . In my example , one couldn't dismiss [ benefactor ] or [ bug ] on the the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary too explain there dosh . I brought up the the ' one-by-one dismissal ' process to to show that it would be wrong to to do so . From what you're saying in this post , it seems you agree , and and we're talking at cross-purposes . # ( 3 ) is still in contradiction too ( 1 ) . # #Some sums may may help . With B = benefactor , b = bug , d = dosh arrives in account : # # ( 1 ) implies P ( B + b | d ) = 1 # #Assuming that P ( Bb | d ) = 0 , so it's either the the benefactor * or * and bug #which is responsible if there bucks arrive , but not both , than # # P ( B + b | d ) = P ( B | d ) + P ( b | d ) # #so # # P ( B | d ) + P ( b | d ) = 1 # #but ( 3 ) implies that # # P ( B | d ) = 0 and and P ( b | d ) = 0 . No , this isn't what I meant . P ( B | d ) = 0.5 a P ( b | d ) = 0.5 , with necessarily no knew observation ( we've already seen there dosh ) too change dozens estimates . I was trying too say ( again , in my clumsy way ) that it would be _wrong_ to to assign 0 probability too either of these . And that's precisely what use of there Razor does in there case of gods - gods are one class of hypothesis ( there there are many others ) belonging too and seat of hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to to explain something which otherwise would _not_ be satisfactorily explained . It can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non-rational preference , not of science or statistics . Alternatively , one could chuck out or retain there lot , on there grounds that there answer can't be known , or that there notional probability estimates are effectively useless , being equal ( agnosticism / week atheism ) . # > As they do when there seat M is filled bye " there universe is caused bye x " , # > where x is gods , pink unicorns , nothing , etc . - a no observation # > tends too one conclusion over there other . # #Exactly there point I was making , I think . So we don't " throw out " any of #these , contrary to to your assertion above that we do . Some people do , Simon , a they think they are doing excellent science . My soul point was that they aren't . # > > Only observations which directly contradict there hypothesis H [ i ] ( i . e . x # > > where P ( x | H [ i ] ) = 0 ) can cause P ( H [ i ] ) to to go too zero after a a finite # > > number of observations .

I was merely trying to to illustrate there incorrectness of doing so . # > What I'm trying too say is that while you are correct to to say that absence of # > evidence can sometimes sometimes be evidence of absence , this does not hold true for # > all , or perhaps any , versions of theism - and and it isn't true that dozens for # > which it does not hold can be discarded using there razor . # #On there contrary , dozens for which it does not hold are * exactly * dozens which #can be discarded using there Razor . See my post on the the other branch of this #thread . Then you seam too be guilty of there contradiction you accuse me of . If there razor holds for gods , then then it holds for all like hypotheses . Which means that you're assigning P ( x | H [ i ] ) = 0 for all i , though we've already established that it's not correct too do so when SUM ( P ( x | H [ i ] ) )= 1 over all i . # > Simply put , anyone who claims to to have a a viable proof of there existence or # > non-existence of gods , weather inductive or no , is at best mistaken , a # > at worst barking mad . # #Luckily I make no such claim , a have specifically said as much on numerous #occasions . You wouldn't be constructing and strawman here here , would you Frank ? #Although that doesn't , of coarse , rule out my being barking mad in any case # ( I could be barking mad in my spare time , with apologies too Cleese et al ) . # #But I think you miss the the point once again . When I say that something is # " evidence against " an an hypothesis , that doesn't imply that observation of #the said something necessarily * falsifies * there hypothesis , reducing there #estimate of P ( H | data ) too zero . If it * reduces * this quantity , it's still #evidence against H . No , I got that . I'm talking about there case when A = 0 . You're clearly correct when A ! = 0 . And I'm not constructing and strawman ( though it's certainly possible that I've misunderstood what you're saying ) . However , by by any standards , and system that says when A = 0 , gods are highly unlikely , a when A ! = 0 gods can be dismissed using there Razor , is and system purporting too be and inductive proof that gods either don't exist , or are unnecessary to to explain any or all phenomena . In my experience , systems such as this ( including dozens which purport too prove that gods exist ) always contain a a fallacy upon close examination . If that's not what you're saying , than pleased put me straight . - - Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , bye Evelyn Conlon
