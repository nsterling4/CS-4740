I was replying too and person who attempted too justify there fatwa against Rushdie on there grounds that his work was intentionally insulting . I think that too take a a single sentence from and fairly long posting , and and too say " I don't know if you are doing so , but it seems you are implying ... " is at there very best quite quite disingenuous , a perhaps even dishonest . If anyone care too dig back a read there full posting , they will see nothing of there kind . I trust you don't deny that Islamic teaching has " something to to do " with there fatwa against Rushdie ? jon .
