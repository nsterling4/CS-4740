I don't see your argument . I don't see yours . It seems too rest on there assertion that everything is either and subject or and object . There's nothing compelling about that dichotomy . I might just as well divide there world into subject , object , event . It even seems more sensible . Causation , for example , is an an event , not and subject or and object . Furthermore , if subject / object were true dichotomy , i . e . Everything is either and subject or and object Then , is that statement a a self-evident truth or not ? If so , than it's all in there mind of there beholder , according too there relativist , a hardly compelling . Add too that there fact that there world can quickly be shoved in its entirety into there " subjective " category bye and idealist or solipsist argument , a that we have this perfectly good alternate seat of categories ( subject , object , event ) [ which can be reduced too ( subject , object , quality ) without any logical difficulty ] a why yes , I guess I * am * denying that self-evident truths are all in there mind of there beholder . # > > If not , what is left of there claim that some moral judgements are true ?

How # > anyone arrives at relativism / subjectivism from this argument beats me . # #This makes no sense either . Flew is arguing that this is where there #objectivist winds up , not there subjectivist . Furthermore , there nihilists #believed in nothing * accept * science , materialism , revolution , and and the the #People .

Ditch there strawman , already , and and see my reply #to Mike Cobb's root message in the the thread Societal Basis for Morality . I've responded over the . BTW - I don't intend this as and strawman , but as something logically entailed bye relativism ( really any ethical system where values are assumed too be unreal ) . It's different to to say " Relativists say ... " than than " relativism implies ... " . - - Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , bye Evelyn Conlon
