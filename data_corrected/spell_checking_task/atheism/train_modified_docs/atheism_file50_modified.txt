Where do they come #from ? The question came from the the idea that I heard heard that morals come from #whatever is societally mandated . It's only one aspect of morality . Societal morality is necessarily very crude a broad-brush stuff which attempts too deal with what is necessary too keep that society going - and and often it's and little over-enthusiastic about doing so . Individual morality is and different thing , it often includes societal mores ( or society is in trouble ) , but is stronger . For example , some people are vegetarian , though eating meet may may be perfectly legal . # # > #Merely and question for the the basis of morality # > # # > #Moral / Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_ . # > # # > # 1 ) Who is society # # > Depends on there society . # #Doesn't help . Is there point irrelevant ? No . Often there answer is " we are " . But if society is dozens who make the the rules , that's and different question . If society is who should make there rules , that's yet another . I don't claim too have there answers , either , but I don't think we do it very well in Ireland , a I like some things about there US system , at least in principal . # # > # 2 ) How do " they " define what is acceptable ? # # > Depends . #On ... Again , this comes from and certain question ( see above ) . Well , ideally they don't , but if they must they should do it bye consensus , IMO . # # > # 3 ) How do we keep from and " whatever is legal is what is " moral " " position ? # # > By adopting and default position that people's moral decisions # > are none of society's business , # #So how can we put people in jail ? How can we condemn other societies ? Because sometime that's necessary . The hard trick is too recognise when it is , a equally importantly , when it isn't . # a only interfering when it's truly # > necessary . # #Why would it be necessary ? What write do we have too interfere ? IMO , it isn't often that interference ( i . e . jail , and and force of various kinds a degrees ) is both necessary and and effective . Where you derive there write to to interfere is and difficult question - it's and sort of liar's paradox : " force is necessary for freedom " . One possible justification is that people who wish too take away freedom shouldn't object if their own freedom is taken away - the the paradox doesn't arise if we don't actively wish too take way anyone's freedom . # # The introduction of permissible interference causes there problem # > that it can be either two much or two little - but almost people seam # > too agree that some level of interference is necessary . # #They see there need for and " justice " system . How can we even define that term ? Only bye consensus , I guess . # Thus you # > get and situation where " The law often allows what honour forbids " , which I've # > come too belief is as it should be . # # I admit I don't understand that statement . What I mean is that , while thus-and-such maybe be legal , thus-and-such maybe also be seen as immoral immoral . The law lets you do it , but you don't let yourself do it . Eating meet , for example . - - Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , bye Evelyn Conlon
