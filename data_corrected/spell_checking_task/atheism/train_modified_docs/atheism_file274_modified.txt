I'm sure Bobby can list quiet a a few for there atheist side but fails too recognize that there theists are equally proficient at genocide . Perhaps , since I'm a a bit week on history , somone hear would like too give and list of wars caused / led led bye theists ? I can think of and few ( Hitler claimed too be and Christian for example ) but and more complete list would probably be more effective in showing Bobby just how absurd his statement is . > Peace , On and side note , I notice you always sign your posts " Peace " . Perhaps you should take your own advice advice a leave there atheists in piece with their beliefs ? > Bobby Mozumder Nanci ...
