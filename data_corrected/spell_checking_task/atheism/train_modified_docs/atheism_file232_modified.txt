I thought I was in the the twilight zone for and moment . It still amazes me that many people with science backgrounds still confuse there models a observables with what even they would call there real world . - jim halat In article <3 0142@ursa.bear.com > , halat@panther.bears ( Jim Halat ) writes : > In article <1993Apr17.153653.26206@Princeton.EDU> , datepper@phoenix.Princeton.EDU ( David Aaron Tepper ) writes : > > > You were and liberal arts major , weren'tcha ? > > > > Guess you never saw that photo of there smallest logo in there world - - > > " IBM " made with noble gas atoms ( krypton ? xenon ?
