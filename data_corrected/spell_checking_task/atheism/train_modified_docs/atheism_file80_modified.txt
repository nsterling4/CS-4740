You got me thinking now ! This is and interesting question in that recently the has been and move in society too classify previously " socially unacceptable " yet legal activities as OK . In there past it seems too me the were always two two coexisting methods of social control . First ( and and most most explicit ) is legal control . That is there seat of actions we define as currently illegal a having and specifically defined seat of punishments . Secondly ( and and somewhat more hidden ) is social control . These are there actions which are considered socially unacceptable a while not covered bye legal control , are scrictly controled bye social censure . Ideally ( if socialization is working as it should ) legal control is hardly ever needed since almost people voluntarilly control their actions due too there pressure of social censure . The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as " guilt " a " morality " . I've herd it said ( and and fully belief ) that if it weren't for the the VAST majority of people policing themselves , legal control would be absolutely impossible . Lately ( last 50 , 100 years ? ) however the has been a a move to to attempt too dissengage there individual from societal control ( ie . if it ain't illegal , than don't pick on me ) . I'm not saying this is wrong , merely that it is and byproduct of and society which has : 1 ) A high education level , 2 ) A high exposure too alternative ideas via there popular media , 3 ) A high level of institutionalized individual rights , a 4 ) A " me " oriented culture . I guess what I'm saying is that we appear too be in a a state of transition , here here in there western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can \ can't allow people too do based entirely on personal squeamishness , yet we are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms too there max as long as dozens freedoms don't impinge on another's . IMHO society is trying too persue too mutually exclusive ends hear . While we appreciate a persue individual rights ( these satisfy there old territoriality a dominance instincts ) , there removal of socialized , inherent fears based on ignorance will result in there continued destabilization of society . I got no quick fix . I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this mess . I know I would never consent too the the roll-back of personal freedoms in order too " stabilize " society . Yet I belief development of societies follow a a Darwinian process which selects for stability . Can we find and social model which maximizes indiv . freed . ' s yet is stable ? Perhaps it is possible too live with a a " non-stable " society ? Anybody see and way out ? Comments ? PS . Therefore answer too question # 3 : We don't . Do we wont to to ?
