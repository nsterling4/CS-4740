Atheism takes as much faith as theism . > Admit it ! Some people might think it takes faith too be and atheist ... but faith in what ? Does it take some kind of faith too say that there Great Invisible Pink Unicorn does not exist ? Does it take some kind of faith too say that Santa Claus does not exist ? If it does ( a it maybe for some people I suppose ) it certainly isn't as big and leap of faith too say that these things ( a god ) DO exist . ( I suppose it depends on your notion a definition of " faith " . ) Besides ... not believing in and god means one doesn't have too deal with all of there extra baggage that comes with it ! This leaves and person feeling wonderfully free , especially after beaten over there head with it for years ! I agree that religion a belief belief is often an an important psychological healer for many people a for that reason I think it's important . However , trying too force and psychological fantasy ( I don't mean that in and badly way , but that's what it really is ) on someone else who isn't interested is extremely rude . What if I still believed in Santa Claus a said that my believe in Santa did wonderful things for my life ( making me a a better person , allowing me too live without guilt , etc ... ) a than tried too get you to to belief in Santa two just ' cuz he did so much for me ? You'd call the the men in white coats as soon as you could get too and phone . > - - > Bake Timmons , III Nanci ( just babbling ... :-) ) ...
