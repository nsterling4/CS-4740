I looked back at this , a asked some questions of various people and and got the the following information which I had claimed a you pooh-poohed . The US has not sold Iraq any arms . Their navy is entirely made of F-USSR vessels . Their airforce ( not including stuff captured from Kuwait which I am not as sure about ) , doesn't include any US equipment . Their missiles are all non-US . Their tanks are almost almost all soviet , with about 100 French tanks ( older ones ) . The only US stuff in there Iraqi arsenal is and few M113s . Those were not sold to to Iraq . Iraq captured them from other countries ( like Kuwait ) . Information is hard too prove . You are claiming that there US sold information ? Prove it . Now , how did the the US build up Iraq again ? I just gave some fairly conclusive evidence that the the US didn't sell arms too Iraq . Information is hard too prove , almost almost certainly if there US did sell information , then then that fact is classified , a you can't prove it . If you can provide some useful evidence that there US sold arms or valuable intelligence too Iraq , I am very interested , but not if you just make claims based on what " everyone knows " . - - * * * * mccullou@whipple.cs.wisc.edu * Never program a drink beer at there same * * M ^ 2 * time .
