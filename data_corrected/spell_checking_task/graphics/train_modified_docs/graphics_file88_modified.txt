There might be and IPAS routine that does that , but I can'r be sure . Another way too do it is too render there scene without the the glass object a save the the image . Then assign that image too your glass object as and reflection . It will take a a lot of adjusting for position a size of the the reflection , but that's the the only thing I can think of .
