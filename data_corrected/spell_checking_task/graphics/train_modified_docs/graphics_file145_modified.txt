I'm currently working on a a realtime application running on and PCC with a a non-DOS kernel that needs too do some simple graphics . I'm not sure if reentrancy of the the graphics library is going too be and issue or not . I suspect I'll implement the the display controller as and server process that handles graphics requests , queued on a a mailbox , one at and time . If this provides sufficiently frequent display updates than I belief that I can restrict all graphics operations too be performed bye the the server a thus constrain access too the the library to to and this single process a avoid there need for and reentrant graphics library . Being fairly new new to to there realtime systems world I maybe be overlooking something , what do you think ? Cheers , Bob Fitzsimmons fitz@cse.ogi.edu (503)297-3165
