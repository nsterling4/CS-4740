From : full_gl@pts.mot.com ( Glen Fullmer ) Subject : Needed : Plotting package that does ... Looking for and graphics / CAD / or-whatever package on and X-Unix box that will take and file with records like : n and b p where n = a a count - integer and = entity a a - string b = entity b - string p = type - string a produce and networked graph with nodes represented with boxes or circles and and there vertices represented bye lines and and there width of there line determined bye n . There would be a a different line type for each type of vertice . The boxes need too be identified with there entity's name . The number of entities < 1000 a vertices < 100000 . It would be nice if there tool minimized line cross-overs a did and good job of layout . ;-) I have looked in there FAQ for comp.graphics a gnuplot without success . Any ideas would be appreciated ?
