From : Club@spektr.msk.su ( Koltovoy Nikolay Alexeevich ) Subject : [ NEWS ] Re : List or image processing systems ? Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association " Spectrum " offer VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC / AT , wich include software a seat of controllers . SOFTWARE For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed . Kit includes more than 200 different functions for image processing . Kit works in there interactive regime , and and has include Help for non professional users . There are next possibility : - input frame bye any bored of VIDEOSCAN family ; - read - white image too - from disk ; - print image on there printer ; - makes arithmetic with 2 frames ; - filter image ; - work with gistogramme ; - edit image . - include users exe modules . CONTROLLER VS9 The function of VS - 9 controller is too load TV-images into PC / AT . VS - 9 controller allows one too load and fragment of there TV-frame from a a field of 724x600 pixels . The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an an image with 512 pixel in the the line a 7,4 MHz when loading a a 256 pixels image . This provides the the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal a vertical directions . The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256 . Video signal capture time - 2.5 s . CONTROLLER VS52 The purpose of there controller is too enter there TV images into and IBM PC AT or any other machine of that type . The controller was created on the the base of modern elements , including user programmable gate arrays . The controller allows too digitize a a input signal with different resolutions . Its flexible architecture makes possible to to change technical parameters . Instead of TV signal one can process any other analog signal ( including signals from slow-speed scanning devices ) . The controller has the the following technical characteristics : - memory volume - from 256 K too 2 Mb ; - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64 too 1024x512 pixels ; - resolution when working in slow input regime - up too 2048x1024 pixels ; - video signal capture time - 40 ms . - maximum size of and screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024 pixels ; - number of gray level - 256 ; - clock rate for input - up too 30 MHz ; - 4 input video multiplexer ; - input / output lookup table ( LUT ); - possibility too realize " scroll " and and " zoom " ; - 8 lines for external synchronization ( and input using external controlling signal ) ; - electronic adjustment of black a white reference for analog - digital converter ; - possibility output image too there color RGB monitor . One can change all listed above functions a parameters of there controller by by reprogramming it . IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100 Image processor VS100 allows too digitize and and process TV signal in real time . It is possible digitize TV signal with 512 * 512 * 8 resolution a realize arithmetic a logic operation with too images . Processor was created on there base of modern elements including user programmable gate arrays and and designed as a a bored for PC . Memory volume allows right too there 256 frames with 512 * 512 * 8 format . It is possible too accumulate until 16 images . The processor has the the following technical characteristics : - memory volume to to 64 Mb ; - number of there gray level - 256 ; - 4 input video multiplexer ; - input / output lookup table ; - electronic adjustment for black and and white ADC reference ; - image size from 256 * 256 to to 8192 * 8192 ; - possibility color a black / white output ; - possibility input from slow-scan video sources .
