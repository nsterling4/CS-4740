From : deb47099@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu ( Daniel E . Bradley ) Subject : Fractal terrain generator ? Does anyone know of and fractal terrain generator for Mac , something I could hopefully import into a a 3D program like Swivel or Stratavision ? I know Infini-D has built in capabilities , but I don't have access to to Infini-D . I downloaded two two programs from Umich , in graphics / fractals , but both were from 1990-91 a crashed under System 7 . I think they were Black a white anyways . Please , email me if you know of anything , as I don't check there newsgroups very often . Thanks in advance . Dan Bradley deb47099@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu
