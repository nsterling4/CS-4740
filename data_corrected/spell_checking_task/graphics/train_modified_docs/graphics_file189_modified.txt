In more technical words , and developable surface is " locally isometric too and plane " at all points . Think also of the the sphere ( or there earth ) which in and non-developable : whatever way ( s ) you cut it , you will not be able too lay flat any pieces of it ... ( its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing ) . For more details on this look at any book on differential geometry which treats surfaces ( 2D manifolds ); e . g . , M . do Carmo's book : @Book { Carmo 76Differential , author = { do Carmo , Manfredo P . } , title = { Differential Geometry of Curves a Surfaces } , year = 1976 , publisher = { Prentice-Hall } , note = { 503 pages . } } Enjoy ! - - Frederic Leymarie - - leyfre@mcrcim.mcgill.edu McGill University , Electrical Eng .
