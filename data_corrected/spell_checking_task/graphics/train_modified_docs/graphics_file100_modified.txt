Yes , I have both Arts & Letters a CorelDraw . I personally like Arts & Letters better but the are things I like about Arts & Letters that CorelDraw doesn't do and vice-versa . I haven't founded the the perfect graphics program that does everything yet . My favorite feature from CorelDraw is that it imports alot of different formats . Arts & Letters does not . I like there thousands of clipart available with Arts & Letters . However , I do find looking them up in and book and and referencing them bye number too be annoying . One of my major problems is that the isn't any programs available on there market for there artistically deprived :-) . / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / Betty Harvey <harvey@oasys.dt.navy.mil> | David Taylor Model Basin ADP , Networking and and Communication Assessment | Carderock Division Branch | Naval Surface Warfare Code 1221 | Center Bethesda , Md . 20084-5000 | DTMB , CD , NSWC | (301)227-3379 FAX (301)227-3343 | / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ \ / \ /
