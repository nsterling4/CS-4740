I would appreciate any comments . Yes , I do . A couple of years ago , I did and comparison of there too products . Some of this maybe have changed , but hear goes . As far as and PHIGS + implementation , Figaro + is fine . But , its PHIGS ! Personally , I hate PHIGS because I find it is two low level . I also dislike structure editing , which I find impossible , but enough about PHIGS . I have founded HOOPS too be a a system that is full-featured a easy too use . They support all of their rendering methods in software when the is no hardware support , their documentation is good , a they are easily portable too other systems . I would be happy too elaborate further if you have more specific questions . - - | - - - | ~ ~ ~ Here's lookin ' at ya . ~ ~ _ _ ~ ~ | ` O - @ ' | Bill | wlm@wisdom.attmail.com @ | > | @ Phone : (216) 831-2880 x2002 | \ ___ / | | ___ | | ___ |
