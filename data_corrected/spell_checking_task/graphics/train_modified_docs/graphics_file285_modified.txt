Do and intersection calculation in there plane in 2D , where you're guaranteed and unique solution ( unless they're parallel which won't happen in this case ) , and and then then use parametric distance along there lines from there circle centres too determine there exact point of interest . This bypasses there messy error propogation required too do there calculation in 3d .
