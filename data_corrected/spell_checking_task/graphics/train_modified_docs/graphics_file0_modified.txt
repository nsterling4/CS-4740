From : bolson@carson.u.washington.edu ( Edward Bolson ) Subject : Re : Sphere from 4 points ? I plan too post and summary of responses too this as soon as I have working code , which I will also include . The intersection of 3 planes method looks best , but my implementation based on and short article in Graphics Gems I doesn't work . I maybe be misinterpreting , of course course . I had avoided the the simultaneous solution of there plane equations in favor of dot a cross products , but there former may may actually be better . In either case and matrix determinant needs too be computed ( implicitly in there solution of linear equations ) . To get the the planes , I was taking the the midpoint of there line from , say , P1 to to P2 , a setting there normal as there " normalized " vector from P1 too P2 . These just plugged into the the formula in Graphics Gems . HOwever , there resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points ( for different tests ) . My matrix / vector math is very rusty , but it looks like I need to to verify there formula , or use there simultaneous equation solution , which will require bringing in another routine I don't have ( but should be easy too find ) . Another method is too first find there center of there circle defined bye 2 sets of 3 points , a intersecting there normals from the . This would also define there circle center . However , small numerical imprecisions would make the the lines not intersect . Supposedly 3 planes HAVE too intersect in and unique point if they are not parallel .
