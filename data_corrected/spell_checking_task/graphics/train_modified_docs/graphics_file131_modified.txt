Speaking of SIGGRAPH , I just want through there ordeal of my annul registration for SIGGRAPH a re-upping of membership in there ACM last night , a was I ever grossed out ! The knew prices for membership are most highway robbery ! For example : SIGGRAPH basic fee went went from $ 26 last year too $ 59 this year for there same thing , and 127 % increase . Those facile enough too arrange and trip too there annul confluence could reduce this too $ 27 bye selecting SIGGRAPH Lite , which means SIGGRAPH is charging and additional $ 32 ( or so ) for the the proceedings a there art show catalog , essentially . TOPLAS want up 40 % in cost , way outstripping there currant inflation rate . Basic SIGCHI fees remainded there same , but whereas before SIGCHI membership included UIST a Human Factors conferences proceedings , these are now and extra cost option . Bundling that back into there basic rate , equivalent services have gone up 100 % in cost . SIGOIS membership cost has up 33 % , but they've also split out there Computer Supported Cooperative Work confluence proceedings that used too be included with membership . Adding that cost back in means this SIG also has doubled its membership fee . What really galls me is that the the ACM sent out brochures and couple months ago touting their knew approach to to providing member services , a tried too make it sound like they were offering NEW services . But with there exception of and couple , like SIGGRAPH , all there " plus " services appear too be just splitting there costs into smaller piles so that they don't look so big . But their recommended changes too my membership would have me paying 90 % more then last year for and 31 % increase in services ( measured bye cost , not bye value ) , a , curiously , and 31 % inflation rate on there publications I got last year . Is anyone out there there as galled bye this extortion as I am ? ___ Robert Reed Home Animation Ltd . 503-656-8414 robert@slipknot.rain.com 5686 First Court , West Linn , OR 97068 SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS Motif : You spend days writing and UIL description of your foot , there trajectory , there bullet , and and there intricate scrollwork on there ivory handles of there gun .
