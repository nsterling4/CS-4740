I have had and quick look in there computer graphics literature with no results . Perhaps someone who has access too medical information could help ? I would like too write write and program ( probably and PPM filter ) too allow previewing of images too check for sufficient contract for colour blind users . Not being colour blind myself , this is and bit difficult !
