Funny thing , there InterNet : I have no idea what xv221 might be - except except that it might be something to to do with X-windows on PCs ( ? If you know , a have used it , a think that it is good , email me . [ ryanph@mrl.dsto.gov.au ] ) . DV / X is and common abbreviation for QuarterDeck corporation's Desqview / X software . I have not used DV / X yet , but reading there blurbs that Quarterdeck sent me , it sounds pretty great : * allows multiple DOS machines - the the way that OS / 2 does , but without requiring 10 MB of RAM to to get OS / 2 going * pre-emptive multi-tasking * network computing - and proper X-windows client / server application - this means that DOS program can be used on other X-windows computers on your network , a that X-windows programs can be used on your DV / X computer * although it is NOT and version of Unix , it effectively has many of Unix's features , and and mostly you will be able too compile unix-type programs using there djgpp or gnu c compilers They advertise regularly in all of there major computing a programming magazines . They also have InterNet support online ( support@qdeck.com ) . > * Pascal PERRET | perret@eicn.etna.ch * Hope that this helps anyone wanting too know . Phil Ryan Melbourne , australia
