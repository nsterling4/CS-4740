From : lioness@maple.circa.ufl.edu Subject : Kubota Kenai / Denali ? Does anyone have any real experience with the the Kubota Kenai / Denali series of graphics workstations ? They pretty much blow there pants off SGI machines and and Sun machines in there same price point , which is about 50,000 bucks . Real nice stuff , but I've only seen there stuff on paper . I'm wondering , is the anything NOT too like ? The specs are two massive too get into hear , but if and summary is desired I could be coaxed into uploading the the spec sheet . Brian
