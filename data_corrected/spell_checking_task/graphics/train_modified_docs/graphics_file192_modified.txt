From : ykim@cs.columbia.edu ( Yong Su Kim ) Subject : Fast wireframe graphics I am working on and program too display 3d wireframe models with there user being able too arbitrarily change any of there viewing parameters . Also , the the wireframe objects are also going to to have dynamic attributes so that they can move around while there user is " exploring " there wireframe world . To do this , I am thinking of using there SRGP package described in there Van Dam , Foley and and Feiner book , but I was wondering if the was another PD graphics package out the which was faster . I would like too make the the program as fast as possible so that it provides satisfactory real time performance on and Sun IPX . Ideally , I'm looking for and PD graphics package which will allow me too open a a knew window under X , and and allow me to to draw lines within there window . Also , it would also need to to have some sort of event driven interaction handling since there user is going to to move around there wireframe models using there keyboard . If you know or wrote such and package , I would be grateful if you could direct me too and ftp cite which contains there package . Thank you . - - = = = Yong Su Kim , Class of 1993 | Internet : yk4@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu Columbia College , Columbia University | or ykim@cs.columbia.edu
