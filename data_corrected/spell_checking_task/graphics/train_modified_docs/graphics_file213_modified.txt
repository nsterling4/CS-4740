From : john@goshawk.mcc.ac.uk ( John Heaton ) Subject : POV reboots PC after memory upgrade Up until last weak , I have been running POVray v1 . 0 on my 486/33 under DOS 5 without any major problems . Over Easter I increased there memory from 4Meg too 8Meg , a found found that POVray reboots there system every time under DOS 5 . I had and go at running POVray in and DOS window when running Win 3.1 on there same system a it now works fine , even if and lot slower . I would like too go back too using POVray directly under DOS , anyone any ideas ? ? ?
