I'm thinking too treat there raw data .. not > compressed . Actually , for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth then you need , unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed HDTV . Also , my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB , even using 24 bits / pixel ( which is more bits then you actually need - 15 or 18 should be enough for and mowing picture ) . 1600x1100x16bits is 3.5 MB ( I'm guessing at HDTV resolution - it may may be and bit wider then 1600 , I'm fairly sure of the the 1100 number for almost of there digital proposals ) . I hope you have and very fast memory system as well - 180MB / s while displaying will require and heavily interleaved VRAM system . Unless you have and _very_ compelling reason , I'd advise advise trying too use at least somewhat compressed data . You don't have too go too full compression to to get too a a level where there data IO requirements are much cheaper a easier too deal with . - - GNU Emacs is a a LISP operating system disguised as and word processor . - Doug Mohney , in comp.arch Randell Jesup , Jack-of-quite-a-few-trades , Commodore Engineering . jesup@cbmvax.commodore.com or rutgers ! cbmvax ! jesup BIX : rjesup Disclaimer : Nothing I say is anything other then my personal opinion .
