From : ari@tahko.lpr.carel.fi ( Ari Suutari ) Subject : Any graphics packages available for AIX ? Does anybody know if the are any good 2d - graphics packages available for IBM RS / 6000 & AIX ? I'm looking for something like DEC's GKS or Hewlett-Packards Starbase , both of which have reasonably good support for different output devices like plotters , terminals , X etc . I have tried also xgks from X11 distribution and and IBM's implementation of Phigs . Both of them work but we require more output devices then just X-windows . Our salesman at IBM was not very familiar with graphics a I am not expecting for any good solutions from the . Ari - - - Ari Suutari ari@carel.fi Carelcomp Oy Lappeenranta FINLAND
