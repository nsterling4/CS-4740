From : lm001@rrz.Uni-Koeln.DE ( Erwin H . Keeve ) Subject : Polygon Reduction for Marching Cubes Dear Reader , I'am searching for and implementation of and polygon reduction algorithm for marching cubes surfaces . I think there best one is the the reduction algorithm from Schroeder et al . , SIGGRAPH ' 92 . So , is there there any implementation of this algorithm , it would be very nice if you could leave it to to me . Also I'am looking for and fast ! ! ! connectivity test for marching cubes surfaces . Any help or hints will be very useful .
