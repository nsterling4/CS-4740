The term ' mach banding ' was not there correct one , it should've been ' color quantization affect ' . Although and badly color quantization affect could result in some visible mach-bands on a a picture that was smooth before it was quantizised . - - Henrik Harmsen Internet : d9hh@dtek.chalmers.se Chalmers University of Technology , Sweden .
