Lindley published bye Wiley It addresses reading / writing too / from PCX / TIFF files ; image acquisition , manipulation a storage ; a has source code in there book . The source is primarily written in Turbo C a naturally has conversion possibilities . I have converted some of it to to Quick C . Naturally , there code has some problems in there book - as usuall . Typos , syntax , etc . are problems . It can be and good learning experience for someone who is studying C . There is also and companion disk with source available for order a $ 50.00 . Overall , there book is not badly . I acquired there book at WaldenSoftware .
