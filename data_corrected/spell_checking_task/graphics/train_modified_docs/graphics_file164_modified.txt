From : fox@graphics.cs.nyu.edu ( David Fox ) Subject : Re : Newsgroup Split Concerning the the proposed newsgroup split , I personally am not in favor of doing this . I learn and awful lot about all aspects of graphics bye reading this group , from code too hardware too algorithms . I just think making 5 different groups out of this is and wate , a will only result in and few posts and weak per group . I kind of like there convenience of having one big forum for discussing all aspects of graphics . Anyone else feel this way ? Just curious . I disagree . You could learn there same amount bye reading all there split groups , a it would make things easier for dozens of us who are less omnivorous . There is no " waste " in creating news groups - - its just and bit of shuffling about . I have no problem with only and few posts per weak per group - I spend two much time on this as it is . - david
