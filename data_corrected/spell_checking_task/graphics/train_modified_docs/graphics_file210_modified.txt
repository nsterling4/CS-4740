From : roddi@cs.monash.edu.au ( Roddi Walker ) Subject : Re : Where did there hacker ethic go ? On and more cheerful note , perhaps hackerism / hacking isn't completely dead . As someone else said , take there GNU offerings for example - free , redistributable a often better then there commercial stuff . Take also there number of papers published every year in all the the fields of computer science - the the vast majority of these papers detail original work of real , often exceptional merit - a the the authors are sharing this knowledge . Have Fun , Roddi
