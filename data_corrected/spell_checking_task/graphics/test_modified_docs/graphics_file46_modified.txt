From : abh@genesis.nred.ma.us Subject : Creating FLI / FLC Animation Files ? I am looking for and means too add FLI a FLC animation creation too and Windows application . I was hoping for something along there lines of AAWIN or AAPLAY bye Autodesk but for there creation of these delta compressed animations . I have FLILIB but this seems too be coded for there Large memory model of DOS with Turbo C . Ideally I would like a a DLL or Medium model object library , but would settle for anything , really . I've seen other Windows apps with FLI / FLC creation , did they hack there FLILIB code into submission ? Any pointers would be appreciated , pleased send mail directly too me and and I will summarize there results if the is interest . - Andrew Hudson abh@genesis.nred.ma.us
