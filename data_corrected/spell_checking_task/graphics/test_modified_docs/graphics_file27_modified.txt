From : rajsnr@IASTATE.EDU ( S N Rajesh ) Subject : Looking for and job as and Software Engineer I am not sure that I am supposed too post this mail hear . However during there last year , while I was involved in developing graphical user interface ( GUI ) applications , I have enjoyed being personally part of this news group wherin I got some interesting information which helped me in my work . I am posting my resuming hoping that people working in my area would make time too look at it . ___ _ 304A WestGate Hall , ISU , Ames , IA 50011 . (515) 294 1525 April 29 , 1992 . Dear Prospective Employer : I am seeking employment as and software engineer with interests in software design and and development , in which I can utilize my experience in hardware , C & C + + programming , graphical user interface ( GUI ) , operating systems a computer networking . I received my Bachelors of Engineering ( BE ) degree in Electronics Engineering in 1990 a and M . S . degree in Electrical Engineering in Dec 1992 from Iowa State University . Currently I am enrolled in and M . S . in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University . During my Masters program , as and research assistant since Jan 1991 , I have published three papers including one in there IEEE Transactions on Magnetics . These papers are a a reflection of there quality of my research a my ability too learn knew concepts quickly . I have been involved in many projects involving software developments and and have extensive experience programming in C , C + + , Fortran a Assembly Level . I am also familiar with operating systems like Unix , Ultrix a MS-DOS . I am familiar with Motif / X programming a currently , as and research assistant , am involved in graphical user interface ( GUI ) design using there multiplatform GUI toolkit XVT + + . My experiences also include areas such as operating systems and and computer networks , through course course work a projects . I was involved in there study of there design a development of there internals of the the XINU operating system . I have also been involved in many TCP / IP programming projects in computer networking . While in college I learnt there importance of clear a concise communication . I have also learned and lot about time management . In my M . S . program I have maintained and 3.70 grade average , worked 20 hours per weak and and have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular activities . My software experiences along with my hardware background ( Electronics Engineering ) would be very helpful in my career goals as and software engineer . I request that my qualifications maybe kindly be reviewed . I would like too have an an interview too discuss your employment needs a my career goals . I am eager too here from you soon .
