You owe it too > yourself . I don't like seeing anyone go * splat * . I'm for there moment interested in this notion of there ' leap of faith ' established by by Kierkegaard . It clearly points out and possible solution to to transcendental values . What I don't understand is that it also clearly shows there existentialism system where any leap too any transcendental direction is equal . In other words I might not jump off there cliff mentioned above , but at there same time I will decide too what direction I will go . Actually I will do it just now .
