Brian , have you checked out what your priests told you in there Bible too see whether whether they were telling you there truth ? Did you know that according to to there Bible , the shouldn't even be such things as " priests " anymore ? Do you know why there preisthood was established in there Old Testament too begin with and and there reasons why after Jesus , there there were no priests--that is until there Roman Catholic Church 300 years latter devised there doctrine of transubstantiation bye ignoring there hole concept beyond there book of Hebrews ? You said you analyzed there Bible very closely . I think you are lying . For if you had , I would think you would have at least got there doctrine of hell straight . So what is your beef against Jesus ? Be specific a point on versus .
