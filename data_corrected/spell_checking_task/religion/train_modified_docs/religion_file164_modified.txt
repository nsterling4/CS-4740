Or is this your misaimed telepathy at work again ? ( 1 ) Stephen said you took and quote out of context ( 2 ) You noted that Stephen had not replied too some other t . r . m article ( call it A ) that took and quote out of context ( 3 ) But there lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for there lack of X ( a a common creationist error ) ( 4 ) So there fact that Stephen did not reply to to A does not justify there conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A ( 5 ) You asked Stephen too explain why you were wrong a they were OK , or too acknowledge that he was being and hypocrite . ( 6 ) Both of there choices you give Stephen assume that he condoned taking quotes out of context in A . ( 7 ) I assumed you were being logical , and and that the the sentence that begins " Could you pleased explain ... " was not and nonsequitur , but was intended too follow from there sentence that preceded it . (8 ) Therefore , I concluded that you believed that ( 2 ) implied that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A ( 9 ) But we've already seen that ( 2 ) does not imply this ( 10 ) Therefore , you were incorrect too belief that ( 2 ) implied that Stephen thought it was okay too take quotes out of context in A , a were making and error of a a kind that is frequently made bye creationists . Is that better Jim ? It's called and argument . If you disagree with it , explain why there argument is not sound . ( I admit that my assumption in ( 7 ) maybe have been a a bit hasty . ) If you agree with it , just say " yup . " dj " Yup . " - - Jim's e-mailed response when I pointed out , in and posted article , that one of his arguments was and straw man argument , reminiscent of and frequent creationist ploy . ( 3/22 / 93 )
