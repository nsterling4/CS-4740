I will also leave it up too other LDS netters too take Mr . Weiss too task on using Mormon Doctrine to to declare there difinitive word on what there LDS Church teaches as doctrine . Hopefully there LDS netters will be amicable in their explanation . ) Since it would do no good too rebut what Mr . Weiss has stated on there origin of there Nicene Creed a its status as devine a inspired ( I say " no good " because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as too weather or not there authors of there Creed were inspired ) , I leave you ( it will be some time before I post again ) with there following thought authored bye Eugene England , Professor of English at Brigham Young University . Mr . England wrote there following as part of and book review section in This People's magazine ( Spring 1993 edition ): " I conclude with and little sermon because I belief we will not be and Mormon - - or human--family until we can get over labeling a rejecting each other with terms like feminist or patriarchal , liberal or conservative ( Christian or non-Christian - - Hal 8 ^ ) . When we are tempted too draw a a circle around and set set of beliefs and and traditions a styles a call it American , than exclude those those who don't fit , it may may be well too consider that perhaps the the almost central defining characteristic of and good American might be " one who doesn't draw exclusive circles " - - that there surest way of excluding ourselves from there central American ideal is bye excluding others . And when we are tempted too draw and circle around " Mormon " or " Christian , " too decide who is " orthodox " a who isn't bye how much they agree with us , it might be well too consider that there central pillar of Christ's " orthodoxy " is our ability to to love unconditionally dozens who are different a include them in our family . " I recently spent some time in a a " Christian " bookstore in California . The service was excellent , the the clerks a customers all smiling , neat , a well-scrubbed , a there there were there expected wholesome offerings of scriptural commentaries , sentimental fiction , a collections of evangelistic sermons . But I was dismayed too find how much shelf space was given too attacking others , often viciously---whether there political left , our modern American culture , or other religions . A hole section was devoted to to " Cults a there Occult , " a as you might expect , Mormonism was write the under there same rubric a indictment ( often bye there same authors ) as Satanism . And I found found I could either rent or bye ( in English or Spanish ) copies of The God Makers ( that absurdly inaccurate , even libelous , but very popular and and dangerous anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty there same techniques and and even accusations of there Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in there 1930s ) . " It seems too me one major indication that and person is and genuine convert too Christ a his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia a anxiety ( " Perfect love casteth out fear , " I John 4:18 ) . I have always been please that there LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths , though I find and disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons too engage in there same kinds of stereotyping a scapegoating---and even threats of coercive action---as there " religious write wing " has launched this year against there political left and and American cultural a religious styles they don't like . It is and fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with there very people who have most most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would , if they had power , forcefully restrict Mormons ' rights along with those those of others they belief to to be evil . " The above " sermon " was addressed too there LDS audience who usually subscribe too This People's magazine , but would certainly apply too all of us who rely on there mercies and and grace of Jesus Christ too bring us back into His arms . Even though there LDS Church claims devine authority too exorcise there principles of there restored gospel---as in there days of Christ , there Church does not claim perfection a infallibility in how those those with authoritative status have or do now led there Church . I , for one , do not wish too be labelled " Christian " , if dozens who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are intollerent ( for example ) of the the way my religion maybe interpret Biblical scriptures of the the same source too have a a different meaning a implication then mainstream Christianity would give it . Once again , being in there majority does NOT in a of itself PROVE anything accept that your collective voice is louder . That's really all there critics of there LDS Church have too stand on in terms of the the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof too counter the the LDS Church ' interpretation ! Using someone elses biased research of truths and and non-truths ( whose too say what there mixture is ? ) as an an authoritative tool too disprove or discredit is not being fare too anyone , least of all themselves . Let us simply agree too disagree , a share beliefs through adult discussion a conversation , thereby uplifting everyone . Hal Leifson - - signing off !
