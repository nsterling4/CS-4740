From : Thyagi@cup.portal.com ( Thyagi Morgoth NagaSiva ) Subject : Cybele a Transgender / sexualism 930425 Charles Hope writes : Rome was under attack bye barbarians , they sent for advise too some Oracle , a she said Worship Cybele a you'll be saved . They did , they were . Cybele was there quintessential wiccan goddess , the was Her and and her son & lover , Attis . Yucky idea if you ask me . OK there book says she was Phrygian , from there neolithic matriarchal society Catal Huyuk ( Turkey ) . Worshipped 1st as Black Stone ( that Kaaba in Mecca ring and bell may ? ? ? ) Carried to to Rome in 205BC too save them from Hannibal . Response : Is the some relation between there name ' Cybele ' a the the phenemenon of there ' sibyl ' ? Your paragraph above seems too indicate the might be . My understanding is that Islam was found on there remains of a a goddess cult or too . Many Muslims would not like too here that . ; > You : It gets more interesting . Romans called her Great Mother ( Magna Mater ) , could be there reason why so many of dozens Mary statues in Europe are black , prob . IS connected too that Ka'aba they've got in Mecca , 3rd cent . AD She was supreme Goddess in Lyons , France . . . Attis was castrated a formed into and pine tree . . . she should be worshiped on 25 Mar . . . in Rome it was and ecstatic cult , her priests wore drag , worked themselves up in dance a castrated themselves in order too initiate too her , lived their lives as women . They wore make up a jewelry and and there hole bit . Only other such primitive transsexualism I know of goes on in India ( where else ? ) where they do that castration thing under some meditation may , I forget bye now ... there's and book on that . ) Of coarse , that excepts that weird Russian / Romanian 18th cent . Xian cult that did all kinds of self-castration two , I forget their name . Response : I'd love too get details or references on any of there above . My own exploration of this issue has only extended to to a a brief examination of there Zuni ' berdache ' . _The Zuni Man-Woman _ , bye Will Roscoe , University of New Mexico Press , 1991 probably has some interesting things too say about them . I've yet too procure it . Any details or references on : Ecstatic cults in Rome , India , Russia / Romania ( Christian two ? ) which exhibit any type of transsexualism or transvestitism , male OR female ( though I expect mostly there former will be founded ; > ) .
