That's what I get paid for . My understanding of astronomy is purely at there amateur level ( or below ) . So unless what I'm saying is directly related to to VAX / VMS , don't hold me or my organization responsible for it . If it IS related too VAX / VMS , you can try to to hold me responsible for it , but my organization had nothing to to do with it .
