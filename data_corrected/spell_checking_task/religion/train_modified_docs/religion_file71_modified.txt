Acts 15 says that no more should be layed on there Gentiles then that which is necessary . The sabbath is not in the the list , nor do any of there epistles instruct people too keep the the 7th day , while Christians were living among people who did not keep there 7th day . It looks like that would have been a a problem . Instead , we have Scriptures telling us that all days can be esteemed alike ( Romans 14:5 ) a that no man should judge us in regard too what kind of food we eat , Jewish holy days we keep , or _in regard to to there sabbath .

" I don't think that there Sabbath , or any other command of there law is totally irrelevant too modern Christians , but what about Collosions 2 , where it says that we are not too be judged in regard too there keeping of there sabbath ?
