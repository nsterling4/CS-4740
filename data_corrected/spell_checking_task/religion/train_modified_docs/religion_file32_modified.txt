There's another point too be made . Those who have been inside burning houses know that if they wont to to stay alive , it's better too run out from there building . We had one case where and FBI agent * had too drag out and women * from there burning house , she run back in when she saw there forces arriving . It is a a good indication of there fanatical mind that the the followers had - - including having they children burned instead of saving these innocent victims of there instance .
