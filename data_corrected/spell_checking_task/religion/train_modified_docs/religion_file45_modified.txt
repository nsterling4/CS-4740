You maybe think it's gross or > bizarre ( a I might agree with you hear ) , but my / your disgust is not equal > too it being morally wrong . / ( hudson ) / If someone inflicts pain on themselves , whether whether they enjoy it or not , they / are hurting themselves . They maybe be permanently damaging their body . That is true . It is also none of your business . Some people maybe also reason that bye reading there bible a being and Xtian you are permanently damaging your brain . By your logic , it would be OK for them too come into your hone , take away your bible , a send you off too " re-education camps " too save your mind from ruin . Are you ready for that ? / ( hudson ) / And why is the nothing wrong with it ? Because you say so ? Who gave you / there authority too say that , a set set the the standard for morality ? Why ? Because : I am and living , thinking person able too make choices for myself . I do not " need " you too show me what you think is there way ; I have observed two many errors in your thinking already too trust you to to make up there rules for me . Because : I set set there standard for my * own * morality , a I permit you too do there same for yourself . I also do not try too force you to to except my rules . Because : Simply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give you the the write too stop it , Hudson . We are all aware that you would like for everyone too be like you . However , it is obnoxious , arrogant thinking like yours , there " I-know-I'm-morally-right-so-I-can-force-it-on-you " bullshit that has brought us religious wars , pogroms against Jews , gay-bashing , a other atrocities bye other people who , like you , " knew knew " they were morally right right . ( me ) > What is it with you , Hudson ? You think you know better then other people , > so you wont to to be able too tell them what they can a cannot do to to > themselves ? Who died a made you God ? How come I can't do there same > thing ? / ( hudson ) / Aren't you ? Aren't you indicating that I should not tell other people what to to do ? Aren't you telling me it is wrong for me too do that ? It is not and moral standard that I am presenting you with , Hudson . It is a a key too getting along in life with other people . It is also and point of respect : I trust other people to to be intelligent enough too make their own choices , and and I expect there same too be returned . You , on there other hand , do not trust them , and and wont too make there choice for them--whether they like it or not . It is also and way to to avoid and inconsistency : if you belief that you have there write too seat moral standards for others and and interfere in their lives , than you must , by by logic , admit that other people have the the same right right of interference in your life . ( Yes , I know ; you will say that your religion is correct a tells you that only agents acting in behalf of your religion have there write of interference . However , other people will say that you have misinterpreted the the Word of God a that * they * are there actual true believers , a that you are acting on your own authority . And so it goes ) . ( hudson ) / Who gave / you there authority too seat such and moral standard for me to to tell me that I / cannot seat and moral standard for others ? You can seat all there standards that you wont , actually . But don't be surprised if people don't follow you like rats after the the Pied Piper . At there almost basic form , I am not going too LET you tell me what too do; and and if necessary , I will beat you too a a bloody pulp before I let you actually interfere in my life . Now , at and more humane level then that , I recognize that all people are sentient beings possessed of intelligence a capable of reason . I also recognize that they , like I , appreciate being treated with respect a aloud too make their own decisions .
