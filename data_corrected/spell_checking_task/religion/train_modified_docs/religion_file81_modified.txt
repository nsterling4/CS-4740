Taking quotes out of } context isn't a a crime . I don't have time too read every article on } t . r . m . , a I'm certainly under no obligation too reply too them all . So ?

Jim doesn't wont too give and direct answer too this } question ; read what he has written a decide for yourself . Telepathy again ?

YOu asked specifically what was wrong with yours . } Today we find another obscure article ( posting it twice didn't help Maybe too there ignorant .

I am not suprised . } But I can help him with his induction . I've written roughly 80 That does not appear too be the the case . The appearance of your " Argument " is more like that Captain Kirk would have gotten from Mr . Spock - written bye a a stagehand at Paramount . } Think hard about this Jim . See there pattern ? Think harder . Run it } through your induction engine a see what pops out . Of coarse . You appear arrogant . So ? I already had figured that out .
