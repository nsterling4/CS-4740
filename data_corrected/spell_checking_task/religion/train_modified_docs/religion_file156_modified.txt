He will kill it if it becomes and threat . For example , let's say there scientist creates and Tyrannosaurus Rex and and it breaks free of its confines a starts devouring there population . The scientist would not hesitate in killing it . God creates us too be His loving companions . He knows weather we are true in our love for Him or not . And He lets us know there consequences of rejecting Him . God cannot abide by by sin . By rejecting God , a a person becomes an an enemy of God , one that must be killed bye Him .
