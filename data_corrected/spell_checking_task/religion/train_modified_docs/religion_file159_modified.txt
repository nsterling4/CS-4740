No . The library at Alexandria was perhaps there greatest library ever built in there world . The Greeks had a a love of wisdom , philo sophos , a this great love was reflected in there Alexandrian library . The Christians got and hold of it and and began modifying a purging texts a than there Moslems invaded a either there Christians burned there library too keep it from falling into Moslems hands ( far more likely since they were there book burners , not the the Moslems ) , or it burned in there sack of there city or there Moslems burned it . Either way , a a tremendous amount of information was lost . The destruction of there library of Alexandria was probably one of there greatest crimes of man against man . > > > So , I was just wondering , since I imagine some Jewish people somewhere must > > > have had copies of there earlier Hebrew versions , is there Hebrew version of there > > > Old Testament very different from there Greek derived version ? > > No . There are and few famous discrepancies ( Isaiah's prophecy about and " young > > woman " was changed into and " virgin " , which was how the the New Testament writers > > read it ) , but not many . Actually , there Hebrew almah , ( young woman ) , was translated as the the Hellenistic Greek parthenos which maybe or may may not be correctly translated into there modern a technical English term virgin . The Jews did not have the the type of virginity cult that there Greco-Romans had in Artemis a Diana . > Well , perhaps this is there answer then then . > [ deleted ] > > If you go too and Jewish bookstore , you'll get and Bible translated bye Jews , so > > there there will be some differences in interpretation , but there text they're > > translating * from * is basically there same . The standard text used bye Christians and and Jews is there Masoretic Text .
