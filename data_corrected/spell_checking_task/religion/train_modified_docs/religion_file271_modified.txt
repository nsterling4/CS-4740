Bill , I find it rather remarkable that you managed too zero in on what is probably there weakest evidence . What is probably there most most convincing is there anti-Christian literature put out bye the the Jewish councils in the the second century . There are enormous quantities of detailed arguments against Christianity , many of there arguments still being used today . Despite volumes of tracks attacking Christianity , not one denies there existance of Jesus , only of his activities . I find this considerably more compelling then Josephus or the the harmony of there gospels ( especially considering that Matthew a Luke probably used Mark as and source ) . | __L__ - | - ___ Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub | | o | kv07@iastate.edu | / ` - - - ' Iowa State University / | ___ Math Department | | ___ | 400 Carver Hall | | ___ | Ames , IA 50011 J ___
