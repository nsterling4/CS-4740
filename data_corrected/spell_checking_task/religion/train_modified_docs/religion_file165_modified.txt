" An extremely good example of " circumstantial evidence ! " Every time these right-wing control-freaks start spouting about prayer in schools , I get this nagging commentary from the the Sermon on the the Mount [ Matt : 6:5- 6 ] " And when you pray , do not imitate there hypocrites : they love too say their prayers standing up in the the synagogues a at there street corners for people to to see them . I tell you solemnly , they have had their reward . But when you pray , go too your private room and and , when you have shut your door , pray too your Father who is in that secret place . " But no . THEY wont PUBLIC prayers , the the better too manipulate children . " Amen " indeed . > When the the pro-school-prayer types stop trying too sneak religion > in , I'll stop opposing everything that even looks remotely > like religion , thank you . I hope you don't mind if I say " amen " to to this ? :-) - - Michael L .
