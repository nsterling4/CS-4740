Good question . I don't have a a nice concise answer , though . What about there child whose parents are crushed emotionally because he / she starts and carerr doing something they greatly dislike . It is the the same kind of harm , a is probably " caused " bye the the same thing : The desire of there child too be true too his or her self . What is more important , being true to to yourself or burying that truth within you in order to to maintain piece in there family ? hard question , no good answer . Lance
