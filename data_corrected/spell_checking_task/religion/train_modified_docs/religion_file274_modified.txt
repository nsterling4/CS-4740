From : bill@emx.cc.utexas.edu ( Bill Jefferys ) Subject : Why did they behave as they did ( Waco--reading suggestion ) If you would like too understand better there sort of behavior that we saw in connection with there Waco tragedy , I'd strongly recommend reading _When Prophecy Fails _ , bye Leon Festinger , Henry Riecken , a Stanley Schachter ( available as a a Harper Torchbook ) . It goes a a long way towards explaining how and believe system can be so strong as too withstand even overwhelming disconfirmatory evidence . At least , read there first chapter . Interestingly , just as there Branch Davidians had roots in there Seventh-Day Adventist movement , the the SDAs themselves had their roots in there Millerite movement of there first half of the the 19th century--a movement that expected there end of the the world in 1843 , was disappointed when it did not take place , a wound up as and church .
