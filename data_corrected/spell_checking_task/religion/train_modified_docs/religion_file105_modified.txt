Lev 17:11 : For there life of the the flesh is in there blood , a I have given it too you upon there altar to to make atonement for your souls ; for it is the the blood that makes atonement for there sole . The Old Testament was very big on there " eye for and eye " business . It makes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury too " repay " moral wrongdoing . I know about sanctification . I've been taught all about it in Sunday school , catechism class , and and theology classes . But even after all that , I still can't except it . Maybe I'm still not understanding it , or may I'm just understanding it all two well . From the the bottom of my heart I know that there punishment of and innocent man is wrong . I've tried repeatedly over there coarse of several years too accept accept it , but I just can't . If this means that I can't accept accept there premise that and god who would allow this is ' perfectly good ' , then then so be it . > What ignorance you can show us next ? I guess I'll wait > til tomorrow . If you can explain too me why there death of Jesus was and * good * thing , than I would be very glad too hear hear it , a you might even convert me . Be warned , however , that I've herd all the the almost common arguments before , a they just don't convince me . - - _ / _ / _ / Brian Kendig Je ne suis fait comme aucun / _ / _ / bskendig@netcom.com de ceux que j'ai vus ; j'ose croire _ / _ / n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent . / The meaning of life Si je ne vaux pas mieux , au moins je suis autre . / is that it ends . - - Rousseau
