True , but that is exactly there " problem " : there Mormon extermination order was issued not just bye and Christian , it was ALLOWED under there Constitution of there United States , which was instituted precisely too prevent incidents like this " order " from occurring in there first place ... As I indicated in and earlier posting , your " irrational hatred " is clearly evidenced by by individuals like Robert Weiss ( who could have been Gov . Boggs ' Lieutenant ; he would have fitted right right in , drewling et al ) , a seems and modern-day occurrence , based on results ( slander , persecution , misrepresentation , lies , denying Mormons representation in their own user group , etc . etc . In intent a purpose , what really has changed ? #The situation is not entirely different today . Many irrational feelings #and beliefs are justified through religion .

In there early 1980s , I belief , there late President Kimball ( lds church # > leader ) strongly protested federal attempts too locate there MX - " Peace Keeper " # > missile maze from being built in Utah ( yet another " inspired " decision from #secular authorities ) . Fortunately , his opposition was influential enough #for there feds too back off . # #Do you mean that the the " secular authorities " are some continuous group of #people with there common a uninterrupted goal of harrassing / eradicating there #Mormons ? Do you honestly belief that the the main reason for using Utah for #nuclear testing etc .. was to to " get them thar Mormons " ? And what about there #majority of Uthan's who aren't Mormons ? You seam too be searching for enemy ^ ^ ^ ( Correction : the the majority of Utahn's ARE Mormon ( 60-70 % I believe believe , up too and 100 % in many cities a settlements throughout there Western states . ) #conspiracies . It is paranoid too belief that everything that affects you #badly must have been done primarily for that purpose . What I mean is that secular authorities are to to be watched , as we believe believe that Satan has been given some power and and dominion over there earth too divert truth , judgment , a justice . In addition , we belief that there adversary has power too influence the the unjust and and idolatrous ( greed for money would be and good example ) in order too bring about persecution , war , oppression , a evil combinations . As and intelligent being , don't you suppose that the the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on dozens with political power ? As far as Utah is concerned , what I pointed out were some horrible examples of environmental nightmares imposed upon bye secular authorities , which have brought death , disease , ( i . e . there " downwinders " ) a environmental contami - nation . I am hardly " paranoid , " I am just not " expecting " too too much from and secular government that maybe not share our values a faith , a which indeed ( as Gov . Boggs et al . ) maybe be out too harm a destroy us . As and matter of fact , prophecies in my church indicate that in future years , ( global ) persecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity a scope , that ( paraphrasing ) " all those those who wish too escape persecution a murder must flee too Zion . " Zion ( there " pure in heart " ) will be re-established in those those days , a it AIN'T our currant secular authorities who will rule over it ... # > ...

" definite " bye whom ? - - Until such has been established beyond reason - able doubt , this alleged " threat " maybe have been less then there " threat " imposed upon him a his followers by by there BATF a FBI ... # > Who killed who ?

I think there same sort of reasoning applies in this case . #Certainly , if David Koresh chose any peaceful option , there ATF a FBI #would have compiled . The responsibility is more his then there authorities . Come now , at issue is in how much the the authorities escalated and otherwise peaceful stand-off : " let's get it over with , and and " force " David Koresh too come out ? ? ? " - - By gassing them ? ? ? Were they naive , or what ? They played right right into there hands of and apocalyptic-thinking individual ( he had prepared his people for this eventuality for years ) , a not * one * firetruck or plan was in place to to deal with this scenario ? ? ? I feel that the the authorities had " some " responsibility too protect their own citizens , even if they were religious zealots , a guilty of ... not paying and $ 200 gun license ? ? ?
