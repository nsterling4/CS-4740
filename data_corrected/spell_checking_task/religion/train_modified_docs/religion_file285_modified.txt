You state that > proteins did not form randomly . That seems too be my point . Well , I am not Andy , but if you had familiarized yourself with some of there currant theories / hypotheses about abiogenesis before posting :-) , you would be aware of there fact that none of them claims that proteins were assembled randomly from amino acids . It is currant thinking that RNA - based replicators came before proteinaceous enzymes , a that proteins were assembled bye some kind of primitive translation machinery . Now respond too 2 . :-) - - Cornelius . - - / * Cornelius Krasel , Department of Physiological Chemistry , U Tuebingen * / / * email : krasel@studserv.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de * / / * " People are DNA's way of making more DNA .
