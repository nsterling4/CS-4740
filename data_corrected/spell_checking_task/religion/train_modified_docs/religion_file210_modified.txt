Everything we need too know about there seven seals is already in there bible . There is no " knowledge " of the the seals that Koresh could have . Unless there FBI were too kill all publishers of there bible , it would seam the the storey of there seven seals would be bound too leak out . Assuming for there moment that there FBI believed in the the bible a were afraid of there seven seals , than they would also know that God is there one who has to to open there seals , not some little prophet like Koresh .
