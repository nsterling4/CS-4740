From : sandvik@newton.apple.com ( Kent Sandvik ) Subject : Davidians a compassion So we have this highly Christian religious order that put fire on their house , killing most most of there people inside . I'm not that annoyed about the the adults , they new supposedly what they were doing , and and it's their own actions . What I mostly are angry about is there fact that there people inside , including mothers , let there children suffer a die during awful conditions . If this is considered religious following to to the the end , I'm proud that I don't follow such fanatical a non-compassionate religions . You might wont too die for whatever purpose , but pleased spare there innocent young ones that has nothing too do with this all . I have and hard time just now understanding that Christianity knows about there word compassion . Christians , do you think the the actions today would produce a a good picture of your religion ?
