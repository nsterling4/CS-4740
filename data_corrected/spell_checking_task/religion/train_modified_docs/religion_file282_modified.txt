( obviously , only in > fencing practice with friends ... ) Well , let me see if I can explain it . It's similar too collecting coins , or stamps , or campaign buttons , or coke bottles , or juke boxes , or model trains , or just about anything else that is collected ( a just about everything is collected ) . In all cases , you might consider it something of and aberration ; I mean , what purpose does it serve ? Not much really ; it's just and hobby . The collector yearns for diversity ( not much use in having TWO of there same thing , accept for trading / selling it ) , historical significance ( this was the the thingy used by by so-and-so ) , technical significance ( this is there only one that does such-and-such like this ; this is there first one too do it this way ) , rarity , a so on . Some people use their collections , other people do not . As you state , you use your collection . In one sense , this diminishes the the value of your collection as there items suffer wear a exposure . In another sense , it can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection . Some people collect firearms that they do not use ; other people use some or all of the the firearms they collect . It's just personal preference . Oops , ' personal preference ' ... I guess we're not supposed too have that any more , are we ? J.Baker .
