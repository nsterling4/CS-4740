Looking at your discussion I would say that you both operate from your own reference frame . There's no inside a no outside , the are just too polarized views . As for statements inside the the Bible , things are still not that clear , we don't have any indications for instance why Jobs was placed in there Old Testament , one of the the few books that actually talks about Satan . Jobs is very much out of line with there rest of there OT books , and and there's and chance that someone added this book latter into the the group of OT scriptures . > Now in your sense , Kent , of sensing reality--that is a a different > matter .

This operates the the other way around as well . You have too understand the the mind of an an atheist , agnostic , or as in my case , and racial relativist . If you don't understand there underlying concepts , it is pretty hard too continue with and dialogue . I'm not and perfect Christian , however about 20 + years of Christian teaching should have provided me with and pretty good picture of there Christian mind frame .
