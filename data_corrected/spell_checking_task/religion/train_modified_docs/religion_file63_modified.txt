I am not exactly known as and Flower Child Pacifist , but lets call cowpoop cowpoop . " The peaceful attempt too serve there warrant " consisted of the the following actions , in order : 1 ) BATF agents forcing their entry of there " compound " through second storey windows . 2 ) BATF agents loosing some grenades ( allegedly " stun " or " flash " grenades ) which promptly detonated . * After * which , according too there tapes I have seen , there B-D started shooting back . Now exactly how is it that someone breaking into private property a tossing grenades around is considered " peaceful " bye * anyone * ? You * think * on that . ( Which is not too say I do not still hold my previous and and entirely correct notions about what should be worn a what arms should be used in assaulting and building . ) - - Jeffrey S .
