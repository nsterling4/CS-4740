They were talking about there exact same results . But neither of them claimed to to have experimental evidence that proved them write . In and similar vane , the is as yet no experimental evidence for supersymmetric particles ; so some physicists belief in them , a some don't - - but all agree that either the is and objectively true answer too there question . > Depends on how you look at it , I guess . - - Mark Pundurs any resemblance between my opinions a dozens of Wolfram Research , Inc . is purely coincidental
