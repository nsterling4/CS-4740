I asked if there deal was good . It isn't . So it was and complete non-sequitur , is that it ? How does coming up with and derisory deal tell us anything about there existence of " objective " values . You're asking us too except that there deal you offered would be turned down , a we believe believe that , not because we appeal too objective values but becasue we know , or think we know , something about people . All there people we know exhibit * subjective * values that would led them too reject a a deal of $ 1 for all of there land in America . Great . Now , so what ? jon .
