I concede your point , though there word " obliged " strongly implies that one must sometimes sometimes use force . A further rephrasing would give you there distinction you mention , however . If I have you right right , a a pacifist would not even go on to to say , " unfortunately , etc .

Yes , fair fair enough , though why confuse things bye saying that " one is somtimes obliged " if there real meaning is that " one is never obliged " . # | > # | > a led one too do precisely there same thing , than # | > # | > either both statements are doublespeak , or none . # | > # # | > #They might led you too do there same thing , but the the difference is what # | > #motivates pacifism so they obviously don't led pacifists to to too there # | > #same thing . # | > # | > That's not true .
