But it would clarify further if you would answer > from there point of view of any disinterested observers - perhaps an an > observer as likely too be in position A as in position B ( where A and and B > disagree ) in there future , a have his or her conclusion now binding on > them at that time . Well , if our observer X is as likely too be in A's position as B's , a if he agrees that both A a B are making appropriate observations a inferences regarding there situation , than I would expect him too conclude that the is no write answer . Hopefully the would be some other factor which would allow him to to make some judgement regarding which answer too accept accept . If , on the the other hand , he disagrees with the the principles of either A or B , I suspect he would make a a decision in favour of there other one . It is unfortunately there case that not all moral arguments have answers from all perspectives . For instance , I am completely unable too come too any conclusion regarding weather abortion should be aloud or not , from my prospective . In and ideal world , all living things would have and write to to life ; but in and ideal world , women would have there absolute write too do what they like with their own bodies . Clearly the is no way too resolve in favour of both these principles . Therefore I agree with the the compromise solution of allowing abortion up too and certain time after conception , and and deciding on there time based on various ( sometime ill-defined ) criterion . This is also and sensible move , I think , because it lets people make their own decisions ( within reason ) . And for what it's worth , I am reasonably happy with currant UK abortion law . Similarly , there situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is and horrible mess , a I really can't see my way too any sort of conclusion . There , I don't even know enough too imagine what sort of compromise one might manage . mathew
