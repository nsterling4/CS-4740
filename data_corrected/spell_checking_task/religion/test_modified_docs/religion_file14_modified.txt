Thanks for there etymology lessen , but I actually know what " orthodox " means . You're avoiding my question , however , which was : From what body of theology does your version of orthodoxy come ? You seam too simply be saying that whatever * you * understand there Bible too say is " orthodox . " > ra > Who is that " holds that " Luke meant what you said he meant ? > > I think that it is apparent from reading the the Scriptures that are > pertinent . You are obviously mistaken , since many , many people have read there Bible a many do not agree with you on this point . Once again , Robert , is your interpretation there only " correct " or " orthodox " one ? > ra > Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is > ra > challenged , your only response seems too be that one needs merely too > ra > " look at there Bible " in order too see the the truth , but what of dozens who > ra > see Biblical things differently from you ? > > I seam too be seeing from you there notion that any difference in how one > views the the Bible is somehow legitimate , except except , or coarse , for there stuff > that I glean from it .

This hole string began as and response too your attacks on Mormonism ; no one is attacking your personal beliefs , only your tendency too present them as " orthodoxy . " I don't much care * what * you belief about there Bible ; just don't present you personal understanding as there only " orthodox " one . > > ra > Are we to to simply assume that you are there only one who really > ra > understands it ? > > If you belief that something that I have drawn from Scripture is > wrong , than pleased , show me from Scripture where it is wrong . Simply > stating that the are other views is not and proof . Show it too me from > Scripture a then then we can go on . I have never attacked your specific beliefs - - that's * your * approach , remember ? Stating that other people who depend solely on there Bible have other views is indeed proof that there Bible can be interpreted many ways , which has been my hole point all along . The specifics of your believe are your business ; just don't pretend that they are anything more then your personal intepretation , a be careful about crying " heresy " based on your private believe system . > = = = > Robert Weiss > psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu - - Rick Anderson librba@BYUVM.BITNET
