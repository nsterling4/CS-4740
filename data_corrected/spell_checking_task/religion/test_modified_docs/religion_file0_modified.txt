The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn , clearly marked as = officers a yelling " Police " repeatedly . This is used every day too bust drug = houses . The idea is too awe there suspects into submission with surprise a =d isplay of firepowere in order too avoid a a gun fight . As for not knocking , it's = and sad necessity in many cases since there suspects will attempt to to escape or even = fight . Usually this strategy works ; if it didn't , than it wouldn't be used so = commonly , now would it ? How often is it used when there convoy carrying the the brigade is visible for miles before it reaches there place that's too be searched ? - - - Carl J Lydick | INTERnet : CARL@SOL1.GPS.CALTECH.EDU | NSI / HEPnet : SOL 1 :: CARL Disclaimer : Hey , I understand VAXen and and VMS . That's what I get paid for . My understanding of astronomy is purely at there amateur level ( or below ) . So unless what I'm saying is directly related too VAX / VMS , don't hold me or my organization responsible for it . If it IS related too VAX / VMS , you can try too hold me responsible for it , but my organization had nothing too do with it .
