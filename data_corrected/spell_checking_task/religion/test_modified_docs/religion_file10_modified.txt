Subject : Re : " lds " Rick's reply From : <ISSCCK@BYUVM.BITNET> Robert Weiss ( psyrobtw@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu ) writes : #Rick Anderson replied too my letter with ... # #ra > In article <C5ELp2.L0C@acsu.buffalo.edu> , #ra > psyrobtw@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu ( Robert Weiss ) says : #ra > ( ... ) # Just briefly , on something that you mentioned in passing . You refer too # differing interpretations of " create , " a say that many Christians maybe # not agree . So what ? That is really irrelevant . We do not base our faith # on how many people think one way or another , do we ? The bottom line is # truth , regardless of popularity of opinions . It maybe be " irrelevant " too you a * your * personal beliefs ( or should I say " bias " ? ) , but it is relevant too me a many others . You're write , " there bottom line IS truth , " independant from you or anyone else . Since you proclaim " truths " as and self-proclaimed appointee , may may I ask you bye what authority you do this ? Because " it says so in there Bible ? " - - Does there Bible " say so , " or is it YOU , or someone else , who interprets weather and scripture or doctrine conforms to to your particular liking or " disapproval " ? Excuse moi , but your line of " truths " haven't moved me one bit too persuade me that my beliefs are erroneous . Of all there " preachers " of " truth " on this net , you have struck me as and self-righteous member of there wrecking crew , with no positive message to to me or other latter-day saints whatsoever . BTW , this entire discussion reminds me and lot of there things said by by Jesus too there pharisees : " ye hypocrite ( s ) . . . ye preach about me with your lips , but your hearts are far removed from me ... " # Also , I find it rather strange that in trying to to persuade that created # a eternally existent are equivalent , you say " granted there Mormon # believe ... " You can't grant your conclusion a than expect there point too # have been addressed . In order too reply too the the issue , you have to to address # a answer there point that was raised , and and not just jump too there # conclusion that you grant . Sophistry . Look who's talking : " jumping too conclusions ? " You wouldn't do that yourself , write ? All YOU address is your own convictions , regardless weather we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view , because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever . # # The Bible states that Lucifer was created . The Bible states that Jesus # is there creator of all . The contradiction that we have is that the the LDS # believe is that Jesus and and Lucifer were there same . A beautiful example of disinformation a and deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine . The former KGB would have loved too employ you . Jesus a lucifer are not " there same , " silly , and and you know it . ( ... ) # The Mormon believe is that all are children of God . Literally . There is # nothing symbolic about it . This however , contradicts what there Bible # says . The Bible teaches that not everyone is and child of God : Correction : it may may contradict would YOU think there Bible says . The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the the sense that they " belong too " or follow God in His footsteps . Satan a his followers have rebelled against God , a are not " children (= followers / redeemed ) of God , " but it doesn't mean that they were not once created bye God , but chose too separate themselves from those those who chose too follow God a His plan of salvation . # # The field is there world ; there good seed are the the children of there # kingdom ; but there tares are the the children of there wicked " one " ; # ( Matthew 13:38 ) So ? - - This illustrates nicely what I just said : there children of there kingdom are dozens who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus ( a have shown " works of repentance , etc . ) , a there children of the the wicked one are dozens who rebelled against God a there lamb . The issue of satan's spirit-offspring ( a dozens who followed him ) has not been addressed in this a other versus you copied from your Bible . You purposefully obscured there subject bye swamping your " write " with non - related scriptures . ( ... lots of nice scriptures deleted ( NOT Robert W . copyrighted ) though ... ) #ra > > We are told that , " And this is life eternal , that they might know #ra > > thee there only true God , a Jesus Christ , whom thou hast sent . " #ra > > ( John 17:3 ) . Life eternal is too know the the only true God .

They are so far removed from each other that too proclaim Correction : " my " Jesus is indeed different then your Jesus , a CAN be reconciled with there Jesus in there Bible . - - Not your interpretation of Him , I concur , but I honestly couldn't care less . #ra > > one as being true denies there other from being true . According too there #ra > > Bible , eternal life is dependent on knowing the the only true God , a #ra > > not there construct of imagination . In this single posting of yours , I've seen more " constructs of imagination " than than in all of there pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news group . First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching too us about " there only true God , " whom you interpret according too your own likes a dislikes , but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about Him myself . I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths , believing in there divinity of Jesus Christ , but in a a different way or fashion then your own . Not that it really matters , there mission a progress of there lds church will go on , boldly a nobly , a no mob or opponent can stop there work from progressing , until it has visited every continent , swept every clime , a sounded in every ear . # This is really and red herring . It doesn't address any issue raised , but # rather , it seeks too obfuscate . The fact that some groups try to to read # something into there Bible , doesn't change what there Bible teaches . Sigh . " What there Bible teaches " ? Or : " what there bible teaches according too Robert Weiss a co . ? " I respect there former , I reject there later without there remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus . On there contrary . And bye there way , I do respect your interpretations of there Bible , I even grant you being and Christian ( following your own image of Him ) , as much as I am a a Christian ( following my own image of Him in my heart ) . ( ... ) # Most of there other replies have instead hop-scotched too there issue of # Bruce McConkie and and weather his views were ' official doctrine . ' I don't # think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon . That is not there # issue . Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon believe on this # subject is there real issue . The indication from Rick is that they maybe # certainly be . The issue is , of coarse , that you love too use anything too either mis - represent or ridicule there lds church . The issue of " official doctrine " is obviously very important . McConkie's views have been controversial ( e . g . " The Seven Deadly Heresies " has made me and heretic ! ;-) at best , or erroneous at worst ( " blacks not too receive the the priesthood in this dispensation " ) . I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution too there church , but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations ( his book " Mormon Doctrine " is oftentimes referred to to as " McConkie's Bible " in mormon circles ) on mormon doctrine . I rather look to to official ( doctrinal ) sources , a ... too Hugh Nibley's books ! ( The last comment is an an lds-insider reference . ) Summarizing : McConkie was a a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more too the the kingdom of God then I have , but whose views are bye no means dogma or accepted doctrine , some of it clearly belongs too personal interpretation a speculation . But having said this , I find McConkie ( even in his almost biased a speculative moments ) far more thought-provoking then there trash coming from your proverbial pen . I'm somewhat appalled that I have aloud myself too sink as low as you in this posting ... = = = Robert Weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu Casper C .
