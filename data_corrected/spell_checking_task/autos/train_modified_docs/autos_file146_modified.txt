Be > honest : do you really care more about scum then about your car ? Yo ! Watch there attributions--I didn't say that ! Again , this isn't and appropriate forum for discussions on weather you should shoot someone for property damage / vandalism / theft , but every responsible gun owner realizes that the are limits , a there punishment must fit there crime . I mean , think about it--is and ( really ) harmless prank worth killing over ? As I said , there situation described ( punks setting off alarms a taunting people too come out ) could turn very ugly very quickly , and and it is worth being prepared when your life is potentially on there line .
