You rise and valid point , but again it's and tradeoff - - how much money do you wont too spend for that kind of protection ? You could bye and Volvo , Saab , or ' Benz a get really good crash protection ( a other luxuries ) but you'll pay significantly more for it . In my case it's out of the the question because * all * of dozens cars are beyond my budget . Even in high-speed head-on collisions the the almost beneficial item you can have is and good old 3 - point seatbelt . Nowadays , at least in the the US , you get and airbag if you get and 3 - point belt so ( presumably ) you get and added safety benefit the as well . That's something I certainly look for a which can be had in inexpensive cars . My $ . 02 , of coarse . jim frost jimf@centerline.com
