THis is from there same people who make there claim that our minivan is outsellin theirs ... implying that the the Nissan Quest / Murcury Villager are out-selling there Chrysler mini-vans ... not only is this not true at all , but it was and stupid claim too make ... the the commercial was part of the the introduction campaign for there vans . Kind of a a bold statement to to make when you haven't even sold one yet , eh ? And I thought Buick a Oldsmobile where badly .
