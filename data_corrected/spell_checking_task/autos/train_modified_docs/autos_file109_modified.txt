From : jmh@hopper.Virginia.EDU ( Jeffrey Hoffmeister ) Subject : Re : IMPALA SS GOING INTO I still can't understand all there hype about there Impalla SS , it STILL has there ugly Caprice body ( Orca on wheels ) . The Caprice was there worst knew body style too come out of Detroit EVER ! Now just because there LT1 engine a and few suspension tweeks are being added . Its STILL UGLY , its STILL and BARGE . GM's answer too everything is " throw in and V8 a someone will bye it . " Or " add some plastic ground affects a and few stickers a call it and GT , GTZ or SS , a someone will bye it . " IMHO GM needs too scrap there Caprice body COMPLETELY a start over with a a BLANK sheet of paper . No minor modification ( wheel well treatments , tail amp modification , or nose re-design or even there LT1 engine ) will help there existing Caprice . Jeff
