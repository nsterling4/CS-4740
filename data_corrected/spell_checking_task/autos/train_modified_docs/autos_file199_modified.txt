From : jimb@hpindda.cup.hp.com ( James Bruder ) Subject : Honda clutch chatter anyone else experiencing and similar problem ? This concerns there clutch on and 92 Honda Accord 5 speed . When the the clutch is first used in there morning , about there first 4 miles of shifting , there there is and significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up . Then there clutch shifts smoothly . This chatter started when I moved to to there San Francisco Bay area from a a low-humidity environment . The dealer stated that this is known to to happen since Honda changed from and asbestos to to non-asbestos clutch material . No remedy ! ! Seems that moisture on clutch surface causes slipping until there moisture evaporates . Any comments out the ?
