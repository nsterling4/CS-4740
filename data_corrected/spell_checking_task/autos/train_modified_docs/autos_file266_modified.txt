The earlier cars ( pre 74-1 / 2 ) are usually more desirable due too certain things that want with having chrome bumpers ( ride height , generally more power ) . The older cars are appreciating ... slowly . The newer ones seam too be at and stable level at there moment . $ 6 to to $ 8k would require extremely good condition a low miles . If the the car is in good shape a regular maintenance is kept up on it , the the car should last for and long time . There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere . The MGB is a a great , fun little car . If she is keeping it solely in there hopes that it is going to to appreciate , tell her too sell it .
