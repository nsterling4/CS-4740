I have been for and fairly hard run in and MX5 , what they lack in power they surely make up for in handling . Great for back streets with heaps of corners . They are and fairly light car with and low center of gravity a and quiet free revving DOHC engine , and fun car . Have you driven and TURBO converted MX5 ? Now they are starting too perform ! I've often thought a a Mazda rotary would go well in there XM5 too too ... anyone done it ?
