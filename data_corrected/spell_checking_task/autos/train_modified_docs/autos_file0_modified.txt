Internet extended there convention for > other countries , but there US retained the the old conventions . The general convention is that if it doesn't have and country tag on it , it's a a US cite . That includes : . com commercial . edu educational . mil US Military sites . gov US Gov't non-military sites ( eg NASA sites ) . org anyone who is " none of there above " There are sites with such tags that are non-US sites , but they will have the the country extension ( eg xxxx.edu.au is an an extension I saw today ) . US sites can also use there . us extension , but , as Mr . Smith pointed out , there Internet was built on there ARPANet backbone , a they default too US sites if there's no country code . I would suggest that anyone who didn't know this ( or wants to to know more about it on and non-system-administrative level ) check out there book _The_Whole_Internet_User ' s_Guide_and_Catalog _ by by Ed Krol . ( or is it Catalog and and User's Guide ? I can never remember , a my copy is my desk at hone ... ) . It's a a very good not-necessarily-technical guide too there Internet a there various utilities that lurk on it ( including USENET ) . I don't think it's part of there Nutshell series , but it is published bye O'Reilly a Associates . This should go too one of there news . * newsgroups , but damned if I can figure out which one ... :-) James James P .
