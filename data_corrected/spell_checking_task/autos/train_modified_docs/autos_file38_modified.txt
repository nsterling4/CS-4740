From : shou@logos.asd.sgi.com ( Tom Shou ) Subject : Ford Explorer 4WD - do I need performance axle ? We're considering getting a a Ford Explorer XLT with 4WD a we have there following questions ( All we would do is go skiing - - no off-roading ): 1 . With 4WD , do we need there " performance axle " - ( limited slip axle ) . Its purpose is too allow there tires too act independently when there tires are on different terrain . 2 . Do we need there all-terrain tires ( P235 / 75X15 ) or will there all-season ( P225 / 70X15 ) be good enough for us at Lake Tahoe ?
