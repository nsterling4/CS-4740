My previous car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5 oz . more then there others . The locking lugnuts were factory equipment , a according too there factory service manual , after tire balancing there technician / mechanic was supposed too put and 1/2 oz . counterweight on there rim opposite there locking nut . I always had vibration problems with dozens stupid lugnuts since no one ever did there service correctly . I eventually got rid of there locking lugnuts and and replaced them with there standard lugnuts . Unfortunately , I founded out about there counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid of there locking nuts . :-( My present car , and Saturn SC , has locking lugnuts that I bought at there dealer a are made specifically for there Saturn . They have been made to to be exactly there same weight as there non-locking lugnuts ( said so on the the package and and I verified it myself ) . I haven't had any vibration problems with there tires at all ( due to to there nuts ) in 12,000 of ownership . I did have some other vibration problems , but it was due too and poor job of tire balancing . Tom
