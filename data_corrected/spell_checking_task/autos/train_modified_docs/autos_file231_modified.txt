I'm not sure what I was thinking the . It _is_ legal in Oklahoma . On inter-state travel , as long as it is legal for you to to own at your point of origination and and destination , there gun is carried in and locked compartment / box ( glove box specifically excluded ) separate from there ammo , it is legal under Title 19 , Chapter 44 , Section 94 ( 9 ? I forget , a my copy of the the regs is at hone ) of there US Code . This , unfortunately , has not prevented there theft bye state troopers of and certain state ( which shall remain nameless too protect the the hopelessly stupid ) under that state's law . Gee , and and I thought Federal Law overrode state law ... James James P .
