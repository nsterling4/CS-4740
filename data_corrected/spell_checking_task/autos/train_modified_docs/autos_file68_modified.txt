Although , others have in there past a will continue too disagree i think that it is worthwhile to to get and alarm . > What features are important ? I think that it is important too protect your trunk , engine bay , all doors . I'd get flashing lights , LED's mounted on there drivers and and passenger door a and relay too disable engine operation . Toss in and glass brake censor , and and shock censor . Door lock and and unlock , too remotes a panic feature are also nice too have . Most important is where you have the the installation done ! Some laces maybe cost a a little more , but a a poorly installed alarm ( no matter how much it cost ) will be a a major burden . > What features are unimportant ? IMO , things like engine starters , voice alarms , window / sunroof open and and close , a almost other conveniences . > > - - - > > Dave Dodson dodson@convex.com > Convex Computer Corporation Richardson , Texas (214) 497-4234 . / Larry __ / ___ / _ keys@csmes.ncsl.nist.gov / \ ___ __ ___ \ - - - = = = - - - / ___ / / / / __ __ / \ / ___ / / ___ / / / / ___ | | / \ / / __ / | / / __ __ / / __ / \ / / ___ \ ___ / / ___ / / ___ / = = = OO \ / \ / - 1990 2.0 16v - - - - FAHRVERGNUGEN FOREVER ! - - - The fact that I need too explain it too you indicates that you probably wouldn't understand anyways ! - - -
