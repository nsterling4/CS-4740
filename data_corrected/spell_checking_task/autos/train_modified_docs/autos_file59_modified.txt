I have and 92 Z28 with and 350 a and 4 - speed auto w / overdrive , a it is really better that way . Chevy autos are reknowned for their long life and and ability too handle copious amount of power . I live in there Dallas area , and and and manual would be much harder too drive in there traffic hear . Now if I still lived out in the the sticks like I used too , and manual would be more fun . Safety-wise , and auto is less distracting ... I would hate too have too be shifting gears while I was trying too ease into traffic in the the freeways hear . Performance-wise , I can hold my own against any stock 5.0 Mustang or 5.0 Camaro w / and five speed . All of this IMHO ... :) - - * Robert L .
