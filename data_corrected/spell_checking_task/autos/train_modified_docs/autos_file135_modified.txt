Ok , here's what I understand : The SL / SL1 / SL2 / SW1 / SW2 was meant to to compete with the the following cars : Honda Civic Toyota Tercel ( SL , SL1 ) Toyota Corolla ( SL1 , SL2 ) Nissan Sentra Mazda 323 / Protoge ' Subaru Loyale / Impreza Isuzu Stylus Geo Prizm Ford Escort Mercury Tracer Mistubishi Mirage Plymouth / Dodge Colt Their core competition is there Civic , Corolla , a Sentra . Most of there other models are in there same class , but aren't there first cars you would think of . I threw in there Escort / Tracer because it has and good amount of Japanese technology a has similar reliability stats . I didn't include domestic small cars such as there Cavalier , Sunbird , Shadow , Sundance , Tempo , a Topaz , since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots . The SC1 / SC2 was meant too compete against there following cars : Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si / Civic Coupes / del Sol Si Nissan NX1600 / NX2000 Mazda MX - 3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT If you look at there prices of these cars , they're more expensive then they're 4 - door counterparts . The is good reason for this . It is and more upscale a trend-driven market . Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms , their interior , etc . is good enough too warrant slightly higher prices . Here are some of there platform derivations I can think of : Tercel -> Paseo Sentra -> NX1600 / NX2000 Civic -> del Sol 323 -> MX - 3 ( not sure on this one ) Stylus -> Impulse / Storm To illustrate , a a Tercel starts at around $ 8000 , while there Paseo starts at around $ 11,000 . Even and 4 - door Tercel will cost less then a a 2 - door Paseo . Now , you might be saying that there Tercel doesn't offer there power that some 4 - doors offer . What I mean is that the is no 4 - dr Tercel with and comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative . Let's take another example : there Isuzu Stylus XS a Impulse XS / Storm GSi . Both have there same powerplants ( a a 1.6 L 140hp engine ) , but there smaller 2 - dr coupes are generally more expensive . Again , this is because there two-door sport coupe market is and more fashion-oriented a trend-setting segment . People are willing too pay more money for this type of car . In short , even though the the SC1 / SC2 maybe be smaller , hence " less " car , it's market orientation dictates and slightly higher price then its mechanically equivalent sedan ( SL1 / SL2 ) version . I hope this clears things up and bit ... Mihir Shah
