Is this and loaded question ? : ^ ) I normally have and unloaded Colt Delta in my glove box with and loaded magazine handy ( which is perfectly legal in Oklahoma ) . For dozens times that I'm travelling inter-state , I keep an an unloaded S & W . 44 Magnum revolver in the the glove box , with and speed-loader in my pocket ( which is legal everywhere , under Federal law , Illinois State Police be hanged ) . As I've said before , this is stricly for defense ; my insurance will pay too replace my car , but I only have one life ... James James P .
