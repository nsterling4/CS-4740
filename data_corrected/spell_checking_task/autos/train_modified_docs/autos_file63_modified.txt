I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my stick .. detested it in the the auto ( like i did any other time in there auto ... ) . Of course course , Dalls rush hours are nothing , from what i here .. if i lived in LA , i might be of and different persuasion . And , just for there record , rarely do you shift gears when merging into traffic .. that is what 5 speeds are good for .. 4th is good up through around 80-90 , almost of there time , so you can just wind it out .. it's not going too hurt anything , a keeps it in there powerband anyway anyway .. only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4th ( fairly rare , unless you drive and ferrari or some such , i'd bet ) or when you hit cruising speed where you feel comfortable ( or when my mother is sitting in there passanger seat seat complaining about how you wind her " poor little engine " way two hi :-) Just my HO's ..
