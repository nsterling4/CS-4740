If and manual transmission is and " must have " , then then there M-B 300TE is not in there running . You cannot get and manual transmission in that car in North America . It seems that buyers hear ( or , may more accurately , there distributors ) are not interested in manual trannies . The ' 93 300 line comes with and 217 hp engine . All earlier years are 177 hp . I have and ' 87 300E , with and " mere " 177 hp a auto tranny , a I find that it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation . More is always nice , but I can't complain . I test drove and Saab 900 CSE last fall . Here are my impressions : 1 ) Awesome power , especially over 3500rpm , when there turbo really comes on . 2 ) If you get on there power really hard in and tight corner , there front-wheel drive causes it to to understeer heavily , a than viciously " hook " into there corner . Not a a desirable handling trait , but common in powerful front drive cars . ( The CSE is 200hp . Mercedes is rear-drive , so it does not have this problem . ) 3 ) Huge interior a cargo space . 4 ) The almost " rubbery " shifter I have ever encountered . I drove and 5spd . It was absolutely numb . You might be able too get used too it - I don't know . I also didn't like its location , which was two far down , a two far write . From there shifter's position , I got there impression that Saab really designed there car for and automatic . 5 ) It was rather noisy : Engine buzz , rattles , a creaks . ( Mercedes does not exhibit these characteristics . ) You should also check out there knew BMW 525 " touring " . This is and wagon version of there 525i . It fits into there class with there 300TE and and Saabs . - - Michael Chmilar chmilar@apple.com
