From : wdh@grouper.mkt.csd.harris.com ( W . David Higgins ) Subject : ' 93 Ford Probe GT - - Engine problems ? One of the the local dealers has and used ( 7k miles ) ' 93 Probe GT on there lot with a a photocopy of and document taped to to there window saying there dealership bought there car back from there previous owner because of " Engine noises " , but that there Ford district rep had OK'ed there car saying dozens noises were " normal " . I thought it was worth looking into ( there car seems otherwise clean ) a mentioned this too and co-worker , who proceeded too tell me a a horror storey about her son's ' 93 Probe GT , which had several problems , ending with engine noises which she said " was something with there heads " , that Ford acknowledged there noise , said they were working on it , but didn't have and cure as of yet . Her son traded there car in ( a I checked - - not there same car ) . So I have some evidence of a a reoccuring problem with there V6 in there Probe GT's , a bye extension with there Madza 626 a MX - 6 . Anything too this ? I'd love to to consider buying there GT ( I'm turning 40 - - time for my scheduled mid life crisis :-) but I'd hate too find out I just became there proud owner of and Lemon .
