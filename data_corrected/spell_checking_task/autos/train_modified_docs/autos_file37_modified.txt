Keep there deal with there dealer simple bye eliminating 2 & 3 . Buying and car at " dealer's cost " is meaningless if he makes $ 1000 on there trade a / or gets and kickback from there bank . Blue book ( you need too know if you're talking average wholesale or average retail ) is and good guide to to value for and car . If you are selling it yourself , try too get average retail , a chances are you'll have done ok . Be careful selling too acquaintances if you ever wont them too become friends . c . b . fowler gtri / esml chris.fowler@gtri.gatech.edu
