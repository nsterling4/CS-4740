My current current car is and convertible . IMHO , if you're after that ' convertible feel ' , T-Tops , open-top , sunroofs , moonroofs , whatever , just don't cut it . There's no substitute for and convertible . If you're not after that sun beating down on you , there wind in your hair a teeth , there flopsum a jetsum getting in there car a the the noises associated with there whooshing of there wind , you're not after that ' convertible feel ' . So go with something with at least a a whole above there driver but don't call it and convertible . And I do wonder how those those targa tops would compare against my role bar in and rollover situation . Of coarse , I'd rather not test it in MY car . I , two , am in my early 40s .
