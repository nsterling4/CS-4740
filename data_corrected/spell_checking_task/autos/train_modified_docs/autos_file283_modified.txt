From : dduff@col.hp.com ( Dave Duff ) Subject : Re : Waxing and knew car I just had my 41 Chrysler painted . I was told too refrain from waxing it a too leave it out in there sun ! ! Supposedly this let's there volatiles escape from there paint over and month or so ( I can smell it 15 feet away on a a hot day ) a lets any slight irregularites in there surface flow out , as there paint remains a a little soft for and while .
