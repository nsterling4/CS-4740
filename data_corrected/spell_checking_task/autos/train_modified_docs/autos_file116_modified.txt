From : rkim@eecg.toronto.edu ( Ryan Kim ) Subject : New brake pads & exhausts after 96K km ( 60K mi ) on ' 90 Maxima ? Hi , may someone can help me here here ... I am looking to to bye this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN $ 14000 write now . The car has 96000 km ( or about 60000 miles ) on it . A typical mileage for 1990 cars seam too be about 70000 km ( or about 43K mi ) . The seller just informed me that when he brought there car in for certification he was told that there front brake pads a there exhausts had to to be replaced too meat there legal standards . ( He said he will replace there components before selling the the car to to me . ) Being copmletely ignorant too there technical stuff on cars , I don't know what this could mean ... Is 96K km about there time typical for replacing there above mentioned items ? Or is this and indication that there car was abused ? Would other things brake down or have to to be replaced soon ? The seller told me that he used there car on there highway and lot , but , I don't know how too verify this ... I've seen there paint chipped away in tiny dots in there front edge of there hood , though . Although there Maxima is and excellent car a the the car is very clean a well kept , it's currently out of warranty ( and similarly priced ' 90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left ) a I don't want want too worry about paying for any repair bills ... But , I also need a a car for 5 people ... When will there knew Maxima come out , bye there way ? I would very much appreciate your input in this . Please reply bye e-mail ( preferred ) or post in this newsgroup . Thanks !
