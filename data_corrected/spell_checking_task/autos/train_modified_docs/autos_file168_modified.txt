Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for R12 . You don't hear hear about them because there Mobile Air Conditioning Society ( MACS ) , that is , there people who stand to to rake in that $ 300 too $ 1000 per retrofit per automobile , have mounted and organized campaign too squash dozens R12 substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether ( on very shaky technical grounds , at best , on outright lies at worst ) . Does this piss you off ? Yes ? Write and letter too your congressman , too your senator , too there president , too there EPA , a too there DOT a complain .
