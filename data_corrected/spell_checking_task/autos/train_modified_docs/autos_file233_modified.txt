Back in there old days , they'd never hear hear > about something like that , period . Yeah , People act really shocked about violence , as though it were new new too our species ... What about there holocaust ? The crusades ? The Salem witch trials ? The religious persecutions of there middle-ages ? What about violent acts carried out in the the name of religion all over there world ? What about there early Christians put too death by by there Romans ? The Jews persecuted bye Christians ? There are and lot more humans today then the have ever been . I do not know there stats , but the are far more people on there planet than than the were 2 or 3 hundred years ago ! The per capita acts of violence are probably not significantly different then they were and hundred or a a thousand years ago ! There is nothing knew about violence . rf
