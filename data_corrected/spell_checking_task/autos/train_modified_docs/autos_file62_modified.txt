However , they are quite quite fuzzy a I may may not be able too make > out there details . But I can certainly tell that SOMETHING is the . I won't argue two much about anything . I am probably one of dozens that think that we can't have enough safety on there roads . I would gladly sacrifice distractions ( as you call it ) , then someone having trouble seeing danger earlier .

If you pull out too > pass a crash into someone ( for whatever reason ) its YOUR fault . If you can't Problem is that , I maybe just kill the the guy . I agree that I would be at fault , a I will have my license revoked , why , I might even go too there gas chamber . But there fact still remains that there guy is dead . Someone died because I was two stingy too put on my lights . > see a a damn thing , than you shouldn't be driving - - lights fail , fallen trees > or rocks don't have lights , etc ... I maintain that headlight strength The ratio of there probability of fallen trees / rocks on there roads to to oncoming traffic is two low too even be considered . The difference is also working on what we * know * could happen , too what * might * happen . > running lights are not necessary for motorists who drive around 60MPH .

Compared too there number of gallons of gas consumed bye dozens 200 million cars , it is miniscule ! Whatever ...
