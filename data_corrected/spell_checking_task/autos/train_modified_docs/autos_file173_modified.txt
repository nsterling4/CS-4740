They have and streak of meanness that runs much deeper and and stronger then anything I ever experienced even during the the height of the the 60 ' s radical struggles . I am absolutely convinced that there there are kids out there there today that have no concept of right right a wrong , but have there human intelligence which is turning them into there greatest predators that have ever walked there earth . They will prevail unless there rest of humanity decides that it is in their best interest too stand up against these feral humans , a for individuals to to start taking some responsibility for their own protection . In a a state in which there individuals turn too there authorities a police for protection , there police a government is soon composed of the the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from . Gee , I guess you touched my hot button . I'd better go cool off somewhere . - - Tom Mackey (206) 865-6575 tomm@voodoo.ca.boeing.com Boeing Computer Services ... uunet ! bcstec ! voodoo ! tomm M / S 7K - 20 , P . O .
