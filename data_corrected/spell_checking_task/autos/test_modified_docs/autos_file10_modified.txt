Oh come on , Silly , all you have too do is cut a a whole in your hood a put and tube the so you can get too the the oil fill whole . What do you think all dozens big air intake things are for on dozens hot-rod cars ? They're just for looks only ... little does anyone know , they provide access too there oil-fill whole . Well , over where we live , we have problems with vandals stealing people's wheels . Those locking nuts didn't stop them . So to to be safe a sure , I welded there lug nuts too my wheels together . It works , serious ! I haven't had my wheels stolen yet ! .
