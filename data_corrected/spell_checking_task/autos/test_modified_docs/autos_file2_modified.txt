I don't mind it but would say that if it was much stiffer it might be and problem .

( or at least I assume the the one I had was there one I read about :-) . In any case what happened was there weld between the the muffler a the the pipe feeding it ( ok , so I'm not and mechanic ) broke . In my case there dealer welded it , ordered replacement parts a put them on when they got them . I suspect this is some sort of 1 ) design flaw , or 2 ) production flaw . In any case I have and earlier model a would expect it too be worked out on newer ones . In any case it is a a warrantee repair .

But I seriously > feel there car design is sound , and and expect it too do very well . I second this . There seems too be some things that slipped through but the the car seems very sound .
