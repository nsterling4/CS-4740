I find this method much better myself , two , although I do really hate it when there bolt finally comes lose a there wrench a my hand both come crashing into my face . After coming to to , which is about 15 minutes later later , I change my clothes ( because bye this time all there oil has drained * on * me ) , a ice my entire face a suck down about 20 Tylenol too ease there pain . Later in there day I than proceed with refilling there engine oil . It's just crazy how I try a change the the oil on my cars in one weekend---I go through about 3 bottles of Tylenol a 2 bags of ice . John
