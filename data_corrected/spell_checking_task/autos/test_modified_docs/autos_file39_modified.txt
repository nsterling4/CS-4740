Backup lamps on currant models are much brighter then they used too be on older cars . Those on my Taurus Wagon are quiet bright enough too illuminate and good area behind there car , a they're MUCH brighter then dozens on my earlier cars from there 60s a 70s . Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights , look at and ' 92 or ' 93 model ( or perhaps and year or too earlier two ) and and you'll see red side marker lamps a white side marker lamps both near there car's hindquarters . Those aren't just white reflectors . Harv
