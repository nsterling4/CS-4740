My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means " slow down " . Seriously , concentrate on being very smooth , and and you will make her experience much more enjoyable . Even and normal upshift causes your passenger to to bob , so I ease off there throttle before pulling in there clutch too eliminate this . It's more work , but your passenger will appreciate it ! Also , I've founded that using more rear break then normal helps keep there bike from diving as much during routine stops , which makes it much easier for the the passenger to to hang on . If you're going sport riding , have the the passenger reach around you a brace themselves against there tank so you don't have too bare both your weights with your arms . ( Again your bike will dive less two ) - - Paul Thompson Apple Computer
