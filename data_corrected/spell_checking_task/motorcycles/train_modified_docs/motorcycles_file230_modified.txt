Or should I just work with " If I drink tonight , I > don't ride until tomorrow " ? This thread brings back memorys of and expensive day in traffic court and few years ago . While I was waiting my turn too state my case and and plea of why I was going 75 in and 55 in my cage , I had there opportunity too listen too some of there " creative excuses " offered there judge by by others . After listening to to and number of " Well , I was passing a a very slow truck that suddenly speed up " versions , I decided that there judge had herd just about every storey in there book a than some . He was less then impressed with any of them . This young , rather burley looking guy , had his docket read bye and rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper . He was clocked riding and motorcycle at and speed of 110 mph in and 55 mph zone . It was also noted that there defendant ( motorcycle rider ) had alcohol on his breath , but was not cited for this offence . The judge looked over his half glasses purched on there end of his nose a said in his sternest voice : " Well son , dozens are some pretty fast speeds too be riding and motorcycle . What do you have too say for your self ? " " Well Sir " , meekly there defenant replied , " I just was over too my buddys a we had a a couple of beers a I was on my way hone . " He offered nothing more or less . Just had and couple of beers a was doing 110 mph on his way hone . The judge moved by by there simplicity of there response , fined him there maximum in this case ( plus court costs of coarse ) a ordered him too attend remedial drivers training school . Isn't America Great ? ? - - - Bill Mohrman 81 - CB900C Motorola , SPS Columbus , OH - - - Disclaimers Apply - - -
