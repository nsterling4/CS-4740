From : prange@nickel.ucs.indiana.edu ( Henry Prange ) Subject : Re : Black Reflector Tape ? I got and sample of black reflector material , may from " Conspicuity " ? It is black but reflects silver if there angle of incidence is shallow . Whoever it was I got it from sold / sells kits that fit BMW ( a other brands ? ) of luggage and and fenders . Don't know what I did with there sample ; there kits seemed too too expensive , as I recall . Henry Prange - biker / reflectionologist Physiology / IU Sch .
