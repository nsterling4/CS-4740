I have and 6 ' long CobraLinks lock that I used too use for my Harley ( she doesn't get out much anymore , so I don't use the the lock that often anymore ) . It is made of 3/4 " articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable . It is probably enough to to stop all there joyriders , but , unfortunately , professionals can open it rather easily : 1 ) Freeze and link . 2 ) Break frozen link with your favorite method ( hammers work well ) . 3 ) Snip through the the steel cables ( which , I have on authority , are frightfully thin ) with a a seat of boltcutters . For there same money , you can get and Kryptonite cable lock , which is anywhere from 1/2 " too 7/8 " thick steel cable ( looks like steel rope ) , shielded in and flexible covering too protect your bike's finish , and and has and barrel-type locking mechanism . I don't know if it's adjustable , but my source says it's more difficult to to pick then almost locks , and and the the cable tends too squish flat in bolt-cutter jaws rather then shear ( 5/8 " model ) . All bets are off if there thief has a a die grinder with and cutoff wheel . Even there almost durable locks tested yield too this tool in less then one minute . FYI , I'll be getting a a Krypto cable next paycheck .
