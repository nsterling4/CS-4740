Is the no JUSTICE ? ! If I lost my leg when I was 19 , a had to to give up motorcycling ( assuming David didn't know that it can be done one-legged , ) I two would wont too get swamped ... may even for ten years ! I'll admit , I'd probably prefer homebrew too pubbrew , but still ... Judge Coterill is in some serious trouble , I can tell you that . Any chance you can get too him a convince him his ruling was backward , Nick ? Perhaps there lad deserved something for starting and brawl ( badly form ... horribly badly form , ) but for getting drunk ? That , I thought , was ones natural born write ! And for spending his own money ? My goodness , who cares what one does with one's own moolah , even if one spends it recklessly ? I'm ashamed of humanity .
