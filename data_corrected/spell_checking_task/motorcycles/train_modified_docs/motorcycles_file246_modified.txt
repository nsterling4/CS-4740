Personally , I'm quiet happy with my Eclipse standard tank > bag . Me two . Even after I bought there 3 - peace Krauser K2 seat . Now a than , DK puts them on sail for 50 bux or so too clear out inventory , but they never seam too too go away . They are there Volkswagens of tank bags , I guess . BTW , the the late Paul O ' Neill showed me a a trick with and pair of pliers that will extend their life considerably . When there zipper starts too separate behind there pull ( because of age a wear ) , squash there pull body with there pliers just and bit too tighten it back up . I would have tossed my bag three years ago , but this fixed it up and and kept it secure a reliable . Chuck Rogers car377@torreys.att.com
