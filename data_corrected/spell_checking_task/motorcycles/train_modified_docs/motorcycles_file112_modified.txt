I would stongly recommend a a factory service manual , a if you are not and experienced machanic than get and chiltons or haynes ( sp ? ) ALSO . Make sure there bike has cooled at least 6 hours since being run . Read there books a if you have more questions you could mail me . Also , be very careful when tightening valve cover bolts . They take very little torque and and breaking one is disaster . Rich Sturges Falls Church , VA
