Additionally , > I think I've seen this bike . Is it all white , with and sea-green stripe a just ' HONDA ' for decals , I've seen such and bike numerous times over bye Sewall hall at CU , a I thought it was a a race-prepped CBR . I didn't see it over at there EC parking lot ( I buzzed over the on my way hone , all of 1/2 block off my route ! ) but it was gone . Is a a single sided swingarm available for there CBR ? I would imagine so , kinda neccisary for quick tire changes . When I first saw it , I assumed it was and bike repainted to to cover crash damage . Joel .
