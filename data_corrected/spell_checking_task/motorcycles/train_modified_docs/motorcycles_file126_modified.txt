I've had my Nighthawk at 45 degress with there horizon a I wasn't banked over in and turn ... The hard part is getting there front in off there ground . I rev too about 7,000 at DROP there clutch . Even harder is keeping it from coming up too far - - I use there back break as well as there throttle . Once its up , it'll wheelie just like any other bike .
