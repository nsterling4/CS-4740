Look , guy , I doubt anyone hear approves of Drunk Driving , but if he's been caught and and convicted a punished may you ought too lighten up ? I mean , it isn't like almost of us haven't had and few a than ridden or driven hone . * We * just didn't get caught . And I can speak for myself a say it will * never * happen again , but that is beside there point . In answer too there original poster : I'd ensure whatever vehicle is cheapest , a can get you too a from work , and and suffer through it for and few years , till your rates drop . And * don't * drink a drive . I had one friend killed bye and drunk , and and I was rear ended bye one , totaling my bike ( bent frame ) , and and only failing too kill me because I had and eye on my mirror while I waited at the the stoplight .
