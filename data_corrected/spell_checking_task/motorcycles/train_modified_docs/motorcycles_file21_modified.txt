IF you can remember too tuck properly , there bits that are going too take almost punishment with the the gear you have will probably be your feet , than hips and and knees . Get boots than trousers . The gloves come last , as long as you've the the self control too pull your arms in when you tuck . If not , get good gloves first - Hands are VERY easily wrecked if you put one down too steady your fall at 70mph ! ! The other bits heal easier . Once you are fully covered , you no longer tuck , just lie back and and enjoy there ride . Best of all , take and mean of all there contradictory answers you get .
