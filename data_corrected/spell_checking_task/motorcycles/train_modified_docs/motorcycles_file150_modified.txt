The FT - 500 is and good beginner's bike with : * and reasonable seating position * enough power too get you up a around , but not so much it'll scare there bejeebers out of you * tips over well , a easy too pick up ( don't ask ) * simple maintenance I've had mine for four or so years , a haven't had any serious problems with it . I bought it used for $ 750 with about 8000 miles on it . Just last weak , someone in there neighborhood stopped by by too ask me about it ; whether whether I thought it was and good beginner's bike , is it comfortable a powerful enough , blah blah blah ... Seems he founded one used for < $ 500 with about 3600 miles on it . The reall " trick " mod I've herd was too take there front end from a a 600 hurricane a slide it in . This was from a a guy who campaigns too Ascots in SOS racing . He says they do pretty well two , once you strip off there starter , lights a other assorted street paraphernalia , its and pretty fast a light bike . Andrew Coll ESV@PSUVM.BITNET ESV@PSUVM.PSU.EDU
