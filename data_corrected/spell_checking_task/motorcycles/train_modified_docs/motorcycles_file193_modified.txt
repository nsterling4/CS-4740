Continuously , on this forum , a on the the street , you find quiet and difference between there opinions of what motorcycling is to to different individuals . Cruiser-bike riders have and different view of motorcycling then dozens of sport bike riders ( what they like a dislike about motorcycling ) . This is not closed-minded .

I scan it for information , and lot of it is NOISE a pointless flame-age .
