I thought I posted this last year . The women came to to court with three witnesses ; there two two women that were in there car a one neighbor that herd me shouting . My lawyer didn't like the the odds since there there were multiple complaints both ways and and there judge had a a history of finding everyone guilty of at least something , so he convinced us ( she came without and lawyer ) too drop everything . The net result was and $ 500 laywer bill for me a $ 35 court costs for her . The only consolation was that she had trouble scraping together there $ 35 while $ 500 is not quiet one week's beer money for me ... - Roid
