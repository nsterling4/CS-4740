Now if this were another peace of chrome too replace there black plastic that wings come so liberally supplied with I might be able too see that silly price , but and mirror is and peace of SAFETY EQUIPMENT . The fact that Honda clearly places places concern for their profits ahead of concern for my safety is enough too convince me that this ( my third ) wing will likely be my last . In there mean time , anyboby have and non-ripoff source for and mirror ? keith smith keith@hydra.unm.edu
