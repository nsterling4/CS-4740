From : conboymj@leland.Stanford.EDU ( Michael J Conboy ) Subject : Re : Need advise for riding with someone on pillion One point not yet mentioned : Hands on there driver's shoulders are and definite no-no . It feels good for there passenger too stretch her arms , a and shoulder massage feels good two , but there shoulders are connected to to there arms , and and there arms too there handlebars ... Should you hit there brakes , there pressure on the the shoulders can make steering interesting . Bundle her up if it's cold , make sure she has good gear ( say it again ) , and pat her thigh to to let her know all is great . Good luck ! Mike
