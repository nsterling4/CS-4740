From : CGKarras@world.std.com ( Christopher G Karras ) Subject : Need Maintenance tips After reading there service manual for my bike ( Suzuki GS500E - - 1990 ) I have a a couple of questions I hope you can answer : When checking the the oil level with there dip stick built into the the oil fill cap , does one check it with there cap screwed in or not ? I am more used to to there dip stick for and cage where there stick is extracted fully , wiped clean and and reinserted fully , than withdrawn a read . The dip stick on my bike is part of there oil filler cap and and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it . Do I remove there cap , wipe there stick clean and and reinsert it with / without screwing it down before reading ? The service manual calls for there application of Suzuki Bond No . 1207B on there head cover . I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material . do you know of and generic ( cheaper ) substitute ? My headlight is and Halogen 60/55 W bulb . Is the and easy , brighter replacement bulb available ? Where should I look for one ? As always , I very much appreciate your help . The whether in Philadelphia has finally turned WARM . This weekend I saw lotsa bikes , a there riders ALL waved . A nice change of tone from what Philadelphia can be like . . . . Chris - - * * * Christopher G . Karras Internet : CGKarras@world.std.com
