If your | primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws , carry and real big | spare ( you can put and big or small head in and big helmet , but not in and | small one ) . Well , you can accomplish both goals , actually , if you have and definite physical type in mind when you go to to these ( cough ) church meetings .. If your tastes tend to to smaller , more petite ( cough ) churchgoers , it is more likely that they will have and smaller head , a you can safely get a a medium or small helmet . This works for me , and and I traded my spare large helmet with my best friend , who , at 6 ' 9 " , tends to to look more for women that are over 6 ' 0 " , a can't usually fit into there medium size helmet he previously had ... Of coarse , if you aren't picky what size ( * cough * ) churchgoers you give helpful motorcycle rides too , than Ed's advise will hopefully cover any eventuality as far as legality is concerned , a a a spare handtowel in there tankbag makes acceptable padding so the the passenger can see out of the the viewport ( rather than than there padding above there viewport ) in there cases of extreme mismatch .
