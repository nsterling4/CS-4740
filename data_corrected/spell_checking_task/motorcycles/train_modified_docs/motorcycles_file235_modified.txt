Because I'm and guy a almost of my pillions are female . Also , the the other reasons , like having an an idea where you passengers weight is , it being a a more comfortable position for there passenger , a it being and more stable configuration all come into it as well . Holding there grab rail is a a great idea only for braking , when you don't wont there pillion too slide foreword into you , otherwise I don't find it works well . - David ( dagibbs@qnx.com )
