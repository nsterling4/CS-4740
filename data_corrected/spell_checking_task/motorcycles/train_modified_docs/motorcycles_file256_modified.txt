I just installed and MC Power Arc II , a it seems too run great . I also used MC coils , and and neither there ignition module or there coils required any knew mounting holes too be drilled on my 92 FXSTC . A little soldering a all was fine . Static timing was real easy too seat two . On there other side of the the coin , my local wrench , whose opinion I invariably seek but don't always adopt adopt , thinks MC Power Arc is and " peace of shit " a says " all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day " . Needless too say , he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules , and and recommends there Dyna-S system . I think that's there one with the the Hall-effect timing censor ( s ) , correct ?
