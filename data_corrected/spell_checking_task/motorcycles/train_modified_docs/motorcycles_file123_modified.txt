From : jscosta@srv.PacBell.COM ( Jon Costa ) Subject : Are other riders welcome too join group When riding in and group , generally speaking , do almost people mind when another rider tags along ? I had the the distinct feeling I maybe not have been welcome when I tagged along with a a group last weekend . Jon Faults are like car headlights . Those of others seam more glaring then our own .
