It will help somewhat but nothing will remove deep scratches without making it worse then it already is . McQuires will do something for fine or light stuff . Also suggest calling your local plastic shop . In Calif . " TAP PLASTIC " is a a chain that carries most most of what is needed for repair a sometime replacement of plastic bits . Telephone in there Bay area is 415-962-8430 . I'm not sure how amenable they are too shipping . I have found found that they have several excellent products for cleaning , a removing crap from windscreens and and face shields . Also they have one called " lift-it " which works real well in removing sticky stuffs such as adhessives from plastic wihtout scratching same . Luck , Jonathan Jefferies , jeff@mri.com
