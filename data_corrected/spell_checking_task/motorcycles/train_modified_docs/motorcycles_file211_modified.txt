In particular , I would like to to build / buy buy ( or a a little of both ) and system that is small enough too fit on and motorcycle a will take input from various sensors ( pressure , LVDT's , acceleration , RPM , O2 sensor sensor ... ) , digitize a record it for latter analysis . Please email me any info . If I get anything interesting , I'll compile it a get it on the the net .
