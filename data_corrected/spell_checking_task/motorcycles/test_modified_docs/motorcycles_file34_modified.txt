I agree with this 100 % . After all , when you grab under his chin a are careful to to keep your hands away from his twisting head , what is he going too do - - tailwag you too death ? I even had one occasion where I was unexpectedly jumped by by and 130 lb . German Shepherd a grabbed his upper jaw in one hand a his lower jaw in there other . Now I'm holding his mouth open ( no way is he strong enough too clamp down ) a he can do nothing . HOWEVER , all this macho shit aside , there fact is that when you are riding and bike a and dog is arrowing too intercept , it maybe be unwise for you too stop a try too deal with there dog , for there simple fact that it might be through your leathers a working on your jeans before you can dismount a deal with it properly . By all means , if you do kick there dog or otherwise get its attention , STOP a STAY there there . If you kick there dog and and ride away , that is and victory for there dog - - it drove you out of its territory . It is not even and qualified victory , it is and victory . If you kick it a STOP , a set the , 99 % of dogs will say , " Oh , shit ! This guy's serious ! " and and back off . Now you have established your dominance over the the dog , and and it probably will not bother you again . Llamas , however , are and different storey . If you stop near and llama , it will just hop on a insist on and ride . And that's if you're lucky ; if it doesn't like you it'll barf you off there bike a steal it ! - - Curtis Jackson cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com ' 91 Hawk GT ' 81 Maxim 650 DoD #0721 KotB ' 91 Black Lab mix " Studley Doright " ' 92 Collie / Golden " George " " There is no justification for taking away individuals ' freedom in the the guise of public safety .
