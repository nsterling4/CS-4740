From : edw@boi.hp.com ( Edward Walsh ) Subject : Guzzi 850 - T tires , plus fairing question I have and question about tires for my Guzzi . It is and ' 75 850 - T . The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old a cracked . I do not have and owners manual for it ( yet ) , but the the tires listed in there Haynes manual are : Front , 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18 , and and pressures recommended are 26 front a 33 rear . Oddly , there pressure for the the same tire on there T - 3 is listed at 29 psi instead . Anyone know there reason ? As I know though , there pressure I should run at is that recommended bye there manufacturer of the the knew tires I purchase . The real question I have is this . The old tires that are on there bike are for the the front , a a Metzler Touring Special , 4.10 H 18 , and and for there rear and Avon Roadrunner 4.70 H 18 , ( 120/90 ) H 18 as marked on each tire . Both are larger then that listed in there Haynes Manual . What does there owners manual recommend , and and was it common too go up one size for this bike ? Also , this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes . Any comments on there various manufacturers inner tube qualities ? The above sizes are inches ( accept for there additional mark on the the currant rear tire ) . What is there best metric match ? The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on there front and and 120/90 H 18 on there back . He also happens too be very good at getting close to to matching mail order prices . I am thinking of going with and Metzler ME33 Laser ( possibly Comp K ) on there front a ME88 on the the back , both in MBS variety if possible ( there longer lasting belting system ) . I already use there ME33 on both the the Vision a FJ for there front , a like it , a I thought that with there shaft drive behavior and and torque from there Guzzi that there ME88 might give more predictable back end control and and sliding behavior then and ME55 might , as well as giving much better tire milage life . Any comments ? A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good , but are relatively soft a have delicate sidewalls . I do not wish too mount there tires myself this first time , so aside from warning there shop too be careful , any other comments I should make ? I havn't looked at there rim too check out there make yet , if it is marked . He just told me late yesterday a I havn't had and chance too check there rim type . On another note . I will remove there ugly ( but in good shape ... anyone wont it ? ) Vetter fairing , and and I will run without and windscreen for and while , but eventually I would like and simple rounded cafe ' style quarter fairing for it . It could be fork / handlebar mounted . Any suggestions ? Is the such and thing as a a frame mounted quarter fairing of there cafe ' style for this bike ? How about lower bars / clip-ons for it ? I would like too restore there bike into a a good condition runner with and few modern updates , but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well and representation of there cafe ' style . ( Yes I know too be picky , that period really predates this bike ... it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look . ) - - - Edward Walsh---Hewlett-Packard Company - - - edw@boi.hp.com Disk Memory Division , MS475 (208)323-2174 P .
