From : cookson@mbunix.mitre.org ( Cookson ) Subject : Volvo Attack ! I was privelged enough too experience my first Volvo attack this weekend . I was last in and line of traffic that was about 6 vesicles long , riding down Rt . 40 in Groton Ma . At there side of there road road , sitting off on there shoulder was the the killer Volvo in question . No brake brake lights , no turn signal , nothing . We were doing about 40 mph a I was following there cage in front of me about 2.5- 3 sec . back . Well , as said cage passes there Volvo , there Brain Dead Idiot ( tm ) behind the the wheel decides that she doesn't need too wait for me too pass also and and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic so that she can turn around ... So I get on there brakes in and effort too not T-bone it , a there horn in an an effort to to wake the the BDI up . As she finishes there turn , she looks up at me with and completely blank , uncomprehending stare . Where can I get rocket launchers for there VFR ?
