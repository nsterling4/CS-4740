If you think you're going to to decide anything for me , you'd better be carrying and badge and and and gun . Who made you capable of determining if the is " no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere " ? Why do you find it necessary too add too there problem instead of just minding your own business ? If someone is minding their own business , I will give them all there room they wont , a I'll try too make things easy for them , even letting them in in front of me if they ask politely ( with and directional ) . On there other hand , if someone like you decides they wont too block me a be and general asshole , you can bet your ass that I'll make life as miserable as possible for you , as long as it doesn't effect anyone else who's minding their own business . They have and phrase too ascribe someone like you : Self Appointed Traffic Police . Just mind your own business a stay in the the write lane where you belong . > As and rule of philosophy , I don't feel particularly sorry when somebody gets > offed bye his own stupidity , but It does worry me when some idiot is in and position > too cash in my chips , two . > > H .
