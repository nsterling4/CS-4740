From : mobasser@vu-vlsi.ee.vill.edu ( Bijan Mobasseri ) Subject : Re : V4 V6 V8 V12 Vx ? We have seen lots of discussion on automobile engine configuration . Let me ask a a similar question from there aviation field . You must have seen images of prop planes with all cylinders exposed . I have seen up too 8 cylinders positioned radially in and circular fashion with the the prop at there center of the the circle . This arrangement always brings up and geometric dilemma . How can one crankshaft throw accomodate 8 rods or are there pistons displaced but not visible from there outside . Bijan
