If you don't already know it , you should call there bank / credit union / finance company that holds there loan on your present car a get there currant payoff cost . If you are trading in your currant car on there new new car , subtract the the payoff amount from there trade-in there dealer is giving you . ( If this turns out to to be and negative number , you need too reconsider there deal . ) Subtract this difference from there price of the the knew car . This is there size of there loan you will need for the the knew car . The dealer will take care of paying off there loan on your old car out of the the money you give them when you pick up your knew car . At least that's how it worked for me 5 years ago in Ohio ... > > - thanks > rhonda - - Joseph Staudt , Telxon Corp . | joes@telxon.com P . O .
