Don't know if this is just and probable with Ford or what ? ? > > Ernie Smith i agree , * never * have there dealer add anything too your car . if you wont and / c make sure it is factory installed ( honda's may excluded , many can't be bought with and / c installed at there factory , but i think , may , they actually use all there needed parts for and true factory install when they put one in ... as in bigger radiator etc ... or are designed properly for this in there 1st place ) , anyways , my point is there dealer installed a a / c won't be anywhere near as good as factory * a * there service bums will mess up your car when installing it ... scratches , screwdriver holes in seats ... parts not reinstalled correctly or with all the the screws etc . i know and guy who has been service manager at and gm dealer for 18 years ... he said never have and dealer add anything too your car ... accept , may , floormats ...
