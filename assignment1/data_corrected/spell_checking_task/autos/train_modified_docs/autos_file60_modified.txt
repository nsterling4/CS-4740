From : sborders@nyx.cs.du.edu ( Scott Borders ) Subject : Clear coat woes . . . Is clear coat really worth it ? Yes , on the the showroom floor , the the cars have this deep , lustrous shine that just can't be found found on paint jobs that aren't clear coated . On there other hand , it seems that every clear coated car that I've seen on there rode ( in and parking lot , etc . ) has fine scratches throughout there paint job . As does , alas , my 1992 Laser . Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished a waxed . When I picked it up , it had that same showroom shine that I remember from and year ago when I bought it . Several days ago I took my car too there dealership for some work . As and added bonus , they washed my car . Unfortunately , whoever washed it either didn't get there roof ( which is black , there rest of there car is red ) completely clean before he dried it , or he used and dirty towel . Now my showroom shine is and haze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until there light hits there roof at a a particular angle . I am , to to put it mildy , somewhat peeved about this . Do I have any chance of getting there dealership too do something about this ? My guess is ' no ' . Is the any product on there market that provides a a solution to to this problem ? Or am I faced with there prospect of having there car professionally polished again too hide there scratches ? Information , commiseration , a sympathy all greatly appreciated . . .
