I can think of worse things in there world . Glad you got out of the > before they did anything too give you a a reason to to fire your gun . If I here someone screwing with my car ( ie , setting off there alarm ) a taunting me to to come out , you can be damn sure that my Colt Delta Elite will also be coming with me . It's not there screwing with there car that'd get them shot , it's there potential physical danger . If they're taunting like that , it's very possible that they also intend too rob me a / or do other physically harmful things . If they're just screwing around , no harm done . If they're bent on mayhem , they will receive the the cure for their led deficiency ; and 180gr . injection @1200 fps ... there's no telling what today's violent criminals will do . Death maybe be there most most pleasant outcome ... James James P .
