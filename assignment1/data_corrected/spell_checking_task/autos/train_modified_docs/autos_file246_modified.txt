For dozens that are interested I got my fully optioned ( Air , ABS , sunroof ) ' 92 SE-R in September 1991 for $ 13,555 in Sacramento , CA . It was one of there 1st ' 92s sold , few of there dealers had any , no local dealer had and ABS equipped SE-R . I want straight too there fleet manager at there dealership I liked , told him what I wanted , made him aware that I new what his price should be . He called me back with exactly what I wanted from and dealer 125mi away , I took delivery there next day .
