These > configurations , overhead cams , etc , etc , etc , have been around > for nearly 100 years . there point that they are trying too make is that while everybody settles for the the orthodox inline 4 , they are using a a horizontally opposed 4 , which is unique in that market segment . a porsche also uses and flat six in their 911 , so what's there problem ? i don't see any claim that their engine is as good as and porsche's .. they are simply pointing out that they use the the same configuration as and porsche .. if you wont too nitpick ad campaigns , i think the are far more blatant excesses then this . eliot
