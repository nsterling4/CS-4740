I'm sorry I let mine go ... I grew up in New York City so I road in many Checker cabs . The jump seats were fun as a a kid . Although there cars were roomy - - and good trait for and taxi - - they had and design flaw that I don't understand they never fixed : there rear passengers tended too fall out of their seats when there driver braked .
