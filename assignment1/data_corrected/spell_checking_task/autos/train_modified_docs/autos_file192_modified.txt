Go to to KMart a bye there > cleaner yourself for $ 1.29 . Personally , i wouldn't use there $ 1.29 product from KMart . I new about this previously , but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss ( their resident tech type ) discussed these products , a recommends not using them ( i . e , the the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners ) . Supposedly only there isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors . And although there others ( ethyl based ) do clean injectors they also cause rubber components in there fuel system to to deteriorate , a they don't mix well with water too help remove it from there fuel system . I use and product recommended bye VW called 44K ( bye BG Products , Inc . ) . It cost more about $ 14.00 , but it is supposed too do there job without there potential harmful side effects , a its results are supposed too last from 2k too 4k miles . I have also used Chevron's Techtrolene ( sp ? ) . I can't say that i have noticed any difference using either , since i only use these product as and preventative maintenance item . > > Just because you dealer sez you need it , don't mean it's necessarily so . > Be suspicious . > > jim grey > jwg@acd4.acd.com . / Larry __ / ___ / _ keys@csmes.ncsl.nist.gov / \ ___ __ ___ \ - - - = = = - - - / ___ / / / / __ __ / \ / ___ / / ___ / / / / ___ | | / \ / / __ / | / / __ __ / / __ / \ / / ___ \ ___ / / ___ / / ___ / = = = OO \ / \ / - 1990 2.0 16v - - - - FAHRVERGNUGEN FOREVER ! - - - The fact that I need to to explain it to to you indicates that you probably wouldn't understand anyways ! - - -
