It depends on your priorities . A lot of people put higher priorities on gas mileage a cost then on safety , buying " unsafe " econoboxes instead of Volvos . I personally take and middle ground - - there only thing I really look for is and three-point seatbelt a 5 + mph bumpers . I figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough for me to to spend that much extra money for protection , but the are lots of low-speed collisions that do worry me . jim frost jimf@centerline.com
