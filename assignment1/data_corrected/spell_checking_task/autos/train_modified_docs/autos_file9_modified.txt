I wonder if this kind of practice is common with Toyota dealers ? > Is there price quote written on there salesperson's business card binding ? > I would appricate any comments . I had and similar experience . We had and written quote which had been mailed too us from there salesman at one of these " no-haggle " Toyota dealers for and Camry XLE w / ABS , leather , etc . The price seemed fare , but when we want in to to take them up on their offer , they " discovered " that certain extra cost items hadn't been included in their original written quote . It would have totaled and extra $ 1100 a , in spite of the the fact that we had and written quote , they said the was nothing they could do . Bottom line , quotes from salemen are worthless a it appears too me that there Toyota dealers think they've got such and superior auto that they don't have too deal . We walked , want out a bought and knew LH car ( Eagle Vision TSI ) and and I don't regret it one bit ! - - Thad McCulloch mcculloc@mail.lds.loral.com
