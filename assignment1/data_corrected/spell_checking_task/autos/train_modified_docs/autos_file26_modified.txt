From : schludermann@sscvx1.ssc.gov Subject : RFI : Art of clutchless shifting I'm wondering if anybody else out there there is and clutchless shifter ? I've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles , on my currant toyota truck I've got over 150k . I've herd people talk about how doing this can damage and transmission . My experiences suggest otherwise . What techniques do you use ? On some old pieces of junk I drove , there transmission was so worn that pumping there clutch was there only way too shift , accept clutchless . To date I've driven rabbits , datsuns , comets , fords & and chevy . Some where harder then others too shift but generally the the higher there milage there smoother quicker & easier they where too shift . My technique is too ease back off there throttle a at there same time gently wrist back on there shift lever . If for some reason I miss there shift window , I lightly press there accelerator & try agian . I've found found that clutchless shifting is eaiser / quicker at high rpms ( 4000-7000 ) . I also skip gears some times using 1-3- 5 , 1-2- 4-5 . krispy
