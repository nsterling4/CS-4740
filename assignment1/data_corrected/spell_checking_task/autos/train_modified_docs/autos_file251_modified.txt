My local Toyota dealer says they > get too and year , a if I wont one I can just get on there waiting list . > Forget about and test drive or even kicking there tires . > And if they are that rare , I doubt there there is much of a a parts inventory on hand . Land Crusier is just simply nice with shit-load of power and and room . Fully stocked , it cost ~ $ 40,000 . I think it is worth there money . Only problem is when you get into accident ( it doesn't usually break break down unless you forget too get and oil change for 30000 miles or something stupid like this ) , body parts a other parts are very hard too locate . Parts are over priced also . One of my friend had accident in past snow storm a he is still waiting for front bumper a passenger side fender . Well , if you test drive Land Cruiser , all other SUV look like toys . One of magazine writer called it " Land Bruiser " . If you have $ 40,000 too spare for SUV , get Land Cruiser a forget Lange Rover . - - Sang
