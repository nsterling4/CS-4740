Women's pants rarely have pockets a almost , when they do , are too too shallow too use ! I is very important for and woman too have her keys in her hand when she goes from building too a a car . It is protect herself from would be assilants bye broadcasting that this is someone who as and definite place of safty ( ie and locked car ! ) . Puting keys a walet looks ugly ! It breaks there lines a makes you rear look wide as and cows ! Also , too have there habits that work for any clothing situation , there pruse functions no mater what you are wearing ! ( even nude or and bikni ) A women's suit coat is lucky to to have 2 pockets ( 2 on there outside , none on there inside ) . I have men's coats that have as much as 6 pockets ! This is definitally not fare ! ! ! As one that wears both men's a women's clothes , I can tell you , women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets ! When dressed as and man , I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket a my keys in and coat outside pocket . It is much more covenent then there pants pockets and and looks better . Having and car that unlocks quickly a locks back fast is paramout too and woman's safty . Men don't see this as a a problem . A woman is aware of this every time she goes out ! ( i . e . Image some red necks yelling at you " We are going to to FUCK YOU ! " a the the out weight you bye 20 lbs and and have 3 inches in hight on you ! ) If you want want to to find out why and women does something , LIVE AS ONE ! Celeste
