But the the original guy did not indicate there year of his MR2 . If it's and first generation car ( like my ' 85 ) , it has 1.6 liter engine ( or perhaps same engine with and supercharger , if it's ' 87 - ' 89 ) . The sound he describes is common too any older Toyota engine I ever herd . I don't know the the relevance of his observations about oil changes , my simply makes noise . Not all that annoying , mind you . But you here it well when there engine is right right behind your left ear :-) Mike . S
