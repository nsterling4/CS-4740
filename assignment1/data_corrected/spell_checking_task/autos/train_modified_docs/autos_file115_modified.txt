Any help > in this is appreciated . Thanks . > Two shots at it : ( 1 ) Check there tires again - if you can see the the wear bars , you're down too problem area ( a some tires pass and penny test between there bars - that's no guide at all ) . Your problem in there whet is call hydroplaning . You maybe not have enough tread left to to channel water out from under there tire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off there rode . ( 2 ) Tires age . In particular , soft tire compounds get harder as you put them thru more heat cycles . Harder compounds don't grip as well as soft ones . Effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very often , such as in competition , but it hits all tires . Bob Benson
