My wife and and I looked quiet seriously at there 626 , Prizm ( Corolla ) , a Civic , as well as some other cars . Our impressions : all three seemed well built a had there features we wanted - these are similar too there features you wont accept for cruise control , a we wont and manual transmission a are considering anti-lock brakes . I also hate automatic seatbelts a we both think having and airbag is a a plus . In general , comfort and and performance were both significant . Some specific + ' s a - ' s are listed below . Mazda 626 + very comfortable a roomy + can theoretically get ABS on DX model , though in practice this is hard too find + base price for base model includes numerous little things like : tach , variable speed wipers , rear defroster , 60/40 split folding rear seat seat - more expensive then many other cars listed below Honda Civic + DX gets significantly better mileage then other cars listed hear + comfortable front seat seat + adjustable set belt mounting - no ABS without EX model ( includes $ 1000 ' s of other things like and sunroof ) Geo Prizm / Toyota Corolla - seats not very comfortable too us ( your mileage maybe vary ) + adjustable set belt mounting + can get ABS without lots of other extras Saturn + SL2 was quiet comfortable , though SL1 less so - motorized attack belts Dodge Spirit no real outstanding + ' s , but seemed generally ok - rear set does not fold down Chevy Corsica + comes with ABS standard - lower " would you bye that car again " a safety ratings in Consumer Reports ( then first 3 cars above ) - suspension didn't feel as stiff as there others ( this would be and + for some ) The Honda Accord a Toyota Camry were both more expensive then there 626 , a in our minds , not significantly better . We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to to there " big 3 " , due ( and ) too my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products , ( b ) some unimpressive GM products owned bye my parents a and housemate of mine ( c ) the the Taurus comes with automatic transmission , I find there set of there Tempo very uncomfortable , a there escort has attack belts a no air bag . We'll probably end up with and 626 - I saw and 626 DX with A / C a cassette advertised for just under $ 12800 ( Washington Post , April 14 , I think ) , a my local dealer says they can match that price . I will probably get there 626 ( maybe maybe tomorrow ) . The main question in my mind is whether whether or not I will have too do and " factory order " or " preference order " too get one with ABS , and and weather or not there dealership will run there price up a a lot if I do so .
