From : lovall@bohr.physics.purdue.edu ( Daniel L . Lovall ) Subject : Buick heater controls I have and ' 71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it . I bought it in California , a if it'll let me , I'd like too keep it for another year . The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work . The car has vacuum operated control switches for there vents . Right now it is stuck in there " vent " mode . It will blow warm air , but I can't switch there air flow too either there floor ( I can live without this ) or there defrost ( I can't live without this ) . I probably could just jam there air deflector too there defrost position , but this blows a a lot of air in my face a is , well , kind of like putting and vacuum cleaner in reverse . I have taken parts of there dash off a looked at the the vacuum system a I think the the problem ( or part of it ) is with there too diaphragms which control up / down a outside / inside air flow . THe diaphragm which controls outside ( vent ) / in - side ( no vent ) air is cracked almost of the the way around , a there other one is probably damaged two , considering there advanced age of there car . Two questions : 1 ) Is the anything I should be aware of about this ( other then there fact that I should move from Indiana ) ? 2 ) In the the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available , is the and way too " fix " this ? THanks for any advise / info selah , Dan lovall@physics.purdue.edu
