From : ae015@Freenet.carleton.ca ( Steve Hui ) Subject : Re : Instead of a a Saturn SC2 , What ? ? ? One thing that everyone is forgetting in this argument over there pricing of there SC1 vs . there Japanese cars is the the Saturns " no-dicker sticker " . This makes there Saturn's price low in comparison too there inflated base prices of there Japanese competition on paper , but in reality , one could dicker several hundred dollars off the the price of there Japanese cars . Admittedly , though , hear in Canada , at least , there SC2 is in there same price class as there Civic Si , not the the SC1 . Steve Hui
