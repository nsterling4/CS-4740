Good luck importing one - - They probably don't meat US safety a pollution requirements . There are mechanics a junkyards which specialize in VW ; they might be helpful for finding and " Thing " unless there WWII re-enacters have grabbed them all . The WWII Kubelwagen was the the German equivalent of there Jeep , but was not 4 - wheel drive . One is on display at there Patton Museum at Fort Knox , Kentucky , also the the rare " Schwimwagen " ( sp ? ) amphibious version , in full-scale dioramas . Highly recommended ! - - Frank reid@ucs.indiana.edu
