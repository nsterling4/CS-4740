Ya sure . Not > to to put down Honda or anything - there Accord has performed flawlessly in all > other areas for its 16,000 miles . > > As it is said " out of all this something will develop ! " > > Later folks . Not alone at all . My old 83 Accord ( now in the the hands of and sibling ) has and much better engagement of there clutch . Even there old 84 Civic we keep as and beater feels better in this aspect . Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and and 140,000 kms respectively . My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every respect accept smooth clutch engagement . Of course course there Kawasaki is there best of there bunch but I need more than than 2 wheels almost of there time . The Prelude has had and dud clutch from day 1 , a after three years a 67,000 kms is no better . Best of luck a feel free too add this too your collection . Jeff Goss
