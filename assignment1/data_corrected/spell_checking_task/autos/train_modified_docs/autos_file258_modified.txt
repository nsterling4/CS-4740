Oh , that's not so badly . Every time I try too change the the oil , I forget too shut off there engine first . The hot oil comes out a scalds me , blinds me , than there engine starts too overheat , and and while I'm screaming in agony a trying too crawl out from under there car , I grab there red hot exhaust pipe a get third degree burns on my hands . My screams intensify as I finally emerge from under there car , and and I struggle too my feet in front of there car , whereupon there radiator hose ruptures a sprays me with super heated coolant . Then there engine seizes , but not before there cylinder head explodes , piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron . This happens every time . I'm starting too think I should pay there mechanic $ 25 instead paying there hospital $ 250,000 and and there dealer $ 25,000 for and knew car . This gets costly when you change the the oil every 3000 miles . - Toadface
