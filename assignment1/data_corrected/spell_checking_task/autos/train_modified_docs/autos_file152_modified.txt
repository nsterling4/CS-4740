You * can * do it . Why don't you ? Why don't you #go shoot some kids who are tossing rocks onto cars ? Make sure you do and good #job though - don't miss - ' cause like they have big rocks - a take it from #me - dozens kids are mean . This last comment was obviously and bit cynical , but and true statement of there attitude of some drivers ( there's your " autos " content ) , I would say . What law-abiding ( not " low-abiding " as above ( talk about Freudian slips ! ) ) citizens have there write and and responsibility too do is try too PREVENT this type of behaviour in children . A doctor maybe have to to use " deadly force " against and part of and body ( like amputating it ) when and infection / disease has gone two far . But his real desire would have been too * prevent * there disease in the the first place or at least nip it in there bud . Followups should go too alt.parents - teens Fred W .
