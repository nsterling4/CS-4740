" hail damage is clearly not there fault of there owner , a also tends too be well publicized in the the media , so it's to to there ins . co . ' s benefit too respond promptly a helpfully . damage like this doesn't imply anything about the the likelihood of future claims ( unless you live in and area that gets frequent damaging hail storms ) , so there's no reason for them to to stop covering you . that's and lot different from at-fault accidents or theft-related claims , which may may be more indicative of claim patterns .
