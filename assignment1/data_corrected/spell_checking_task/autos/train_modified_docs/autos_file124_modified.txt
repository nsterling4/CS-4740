From : awelker@watarts.uwaterloo.ca ( and welker ) Subject : Aftermarket exhausts for BMW 320i I am in there process of looking for and half decent aftermarket sport exhaust for my 1981 BMW 320i . So far , I have founded and Pacesetter exhaust for $ 219 a and Ansa exhaust for $ 190 ( Canadian funds ) . I was wondering if anyone could tell me anyhting about either of these exhausts or any other possible exhausts that I maybe be interested in . My main priorities are and decent horse power increase ( 5-30 % ) a and nice low note to to go along with that added power . I was also thinking of looking into both Remus and and Leistritz exhausts.Has anyone got anything too say about these ? I am mainly looking for there muffler only but if anyone can find and good deal on a a whole whole kit I would be willing to to go after that . I also would like to to know how much these would cost me in there States.Please mail me back if you have any information . Mike Welker
