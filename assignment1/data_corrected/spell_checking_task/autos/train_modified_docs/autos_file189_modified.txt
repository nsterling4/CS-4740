So far I have $ Miata , Tredia , Previa , Sentra , Maxima , Altima , Camry , a Justy , not to to $ mention Lexus , Acura and and Infiniti ! You're apparently including names that are , or appear too be , derivatives of real words in English or some other language ( e . g . Acura , Infiniti , Maxima , Altima ) , in which case you missed ones such as Integra , Supra , Allante ' , Capri a Calibra . In Canada , add Serenia a Precidia . If you count misspellings , add Protege a ( in Canada ) Vigor . How about there forthcoming Mondeo , if it is given that name in North America ? Others might include Celica , Corolla , Paseo , a Tercel . In Canada , add Asu " na . - - | I know that sometime my jaw clicks when I eat . Void where prohibited . | | Have you seen this boy ?
