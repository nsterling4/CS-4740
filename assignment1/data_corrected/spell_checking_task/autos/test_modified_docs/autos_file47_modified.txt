I had and ' 82 Saab 900 Turbo , a now have and ' 87 BMW 325is There is no comparison for handling , reliability , or overall quality of engineering . The BMW wins hands down . After 5 years I was sick a tired of the the all there little problems a entropic decay of there SAAB . The 6 - year old BMW is still as sweet as it was knew . But I see you are posting from western MA . BMW's * * SUCK * * in there snow . I have aggressive snows , plus and hundred pounds of sand in there back , a I still try too avoid driving in there snow . I happily took there SAAB through blizzard conditions without a a worry . I would say this is there single design flaw in there BMW . - - Jonathan Edwards edwards@intranet.com IntraNet , Inc 617-527-7020
