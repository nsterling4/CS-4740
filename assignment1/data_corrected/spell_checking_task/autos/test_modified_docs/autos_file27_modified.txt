From : dchan@cisco.com ( Derek Chan ) Subject : service indicator of a a BMW Does anyone know how too reset there service indicator of and BMW after changing the the oil yourself ? Also , I have about 3,000 miles on my 525i a so far only one of there five yellow service indicators went went out . That means I don't need oil service until it reach approximatly 15,000 miles which doesn't make sense too me . Any idea ? PS of cause I did my first oil change at 1,200 miles Derek
