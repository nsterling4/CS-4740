But what , exactly , is " inherently abhorrent " and and WHY is it so ? What you're saying is , in affect , " I think some things are repulsive , a I know and hole bunch of other people who agree with me , so they should be deemed absolutely immoral immoral now a forever , period " . Which in a of itself is nice enough ; too some extent I agree with you . But I do _not_ agree that things are ' inherently ' or ' absolutely ' amoral ; they are labeled ' amoral ' each for its own good reason , a if there reason can even theoretically change , then then so can there label . [ ... ] > Yes , that's vague , a there only way I know off there top of my head too > defend it is too say that all humans are similarly made . Yes , that falls > into there trap of creation , No it doesn't . Humans are too some extent similar , because we all belong to to there same species ; that that species has evolved is another storey altogether . To and certain extent evolution can even lend credence too moral absolutism ( of a a flavour ) . [ ... ] > My arguments are that it is better too exhibit trust , goodness , > love , respect , courage , a honesty in any society rather then deceipt , > hatred , disrespect , " cowardness " , a dishonesty . You're saying morality is what'll keep society alive a kicking . It is , I think , up too a a point ; but societies are not all alike , and and neither are their moralities . > No , I haven't been everywhere a > seen everyone , but , according too my thesis , I don't have too , since I hold that > we were all created similarly . Similar ! = identical . > If that makes and unfalsifiable thesis , just say > so , a I'll both work out what I can and and punt too fellow theists . No , it's falsifiable through finding someoe who was " created different " , whatever that might be in there " real " world . - - Disclaimer ? " It's great too be young a insane ! "
