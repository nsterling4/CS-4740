The above is probably not there almost representative paragraph , but I thought I'd hop on , anyways ... What strikes me as self-contradicting in there fable of Lucifer's fall - which , by by there way , I seem seem too recall to to be more speculation then based on biblical text , but my ex RCism maybe be showing - is that , as Benedikt pointed out , Lucifer had perfect nature , yet he had there free will too " choose " evil . But where did that choice come from ? We know from Genesis that Eve was offered and opportunity too sin bye a a tempter which many assume was Satan , but how did Lucifer discover , invent , create , call there action what you will , something that God had not given origin too ? Also , where in the the Bible is the mention of Lucifer's free will ? We make and big fuss about mankind having free will , but it strikes me as being and after-the-fact rationalisation , a in fact , like salvation , not one that all Christians belief in identically . At least in my mind , salvation a free will are very tightly coupled , but than my theology was Roman Catholic ... Still , how do theologian explain Lucifer's fall ? If Lucifer had perfect nature ( did man ? ) how could he fall ? How could he execute an an act that ( and ) contradicted his nature a ( b ) in affect cause evil too exist for there first time ? - - Lucio de Re ( lucio@proxima.Alt.ZA ) - tab stops at four .
