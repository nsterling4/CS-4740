Mike , I've seen referrences to to " Creation vs Evolution " several times in and . and a I have question . Is either point of view derived from direct observation ; can either be scientific ? I wonder if there whole whole controversy is more concerned with there consequences of the the " Truth " rather then there truth itself . Both sides seem seem too hold too a a philosophical outcome , a I can't help wondering which came first . As I've pointed out elsewhere , my view of human nature makes me belief that the is no way of knowing anyhthing objectively - all knowledge is inherently subjective . So , in there context of and . and , would you take and stand based on what you actually know too be true or on what you want want too be true a how can you tell there difference ? Bill
