Yes , but also many people who are not trying to to make government recognize Christianity as the the dominant religion in this country do no think there motto infringes upon there rights of others who do not share their beliefs . And actually , I think that there government already does recognize that Christianity is there dominant religion in this country . I mean , it is . Don't you realize / recognize this ? This isn't too say that we are supposed too believe believe the the teachings of Christianity , just that almost people do . > Like I've said before I personally don't think there motto is and major > concern .

Wouldn't this figure be more prominent if there holiday were really associated too and high degree with him ? Or are you saying that there association with Jesus is on and personal level , a that everyone thinks about it but just never talks about it ? That is , can * you * prove that most most people * do * associate Christmas almost importantly with Jesus ? > Anyways , there point again is that the are people who do associate > Christmas with Jesus .

Doesn't it ? keith
