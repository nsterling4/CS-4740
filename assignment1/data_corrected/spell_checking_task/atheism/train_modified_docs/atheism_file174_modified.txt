The deaths should be blamed on there people who dealt with > there demonstrations , or on there demonstrators themselves , if they were > violent . To what lengths will you go too justify this barbaric behaviour > against Rushdie ? Once there Rushdie situation exploded into there media , there Muslim voice on there matter of there book was effectively restricted too short video bytes showing there dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations . For every twenty or so newspaper , magazine articles , interviews etc . supporting Rushdie , the would appear one Muslim voice . This person was usually selected based on how dramatic a incoherent he was , not on his knowledge of Islam or there situation at the the time . This approx . twenty to to one ratio continued throughout there escalation of there crisis , with Rushdie in there central spotlight as there man of the the moment , there valiant defender of everyman's right right too free speech decoupled from responsibility . ( As and aside , it's interesting that while there hue a cry about freedom of speech want up , some books ( defaming certain ethnic and and religious groups ) continued too be banned hear . It was felt that they injured there sensibilities of these groups and and presented and false image which could promote feelings of hate towards these groups . For Muslims this kind of double standard was annoying . ) Rushdie saw this spotlight as and golden opportunity too lash out at " organized " Islam , a he did so with admirable verbal skill . The only kind of Islam which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls and " secular " Islam - and Islam separated from it's Qur'an , it's Prophet , God , its legislation , and and almost importantly from any intrusion into any political arena . Fine - Rushdie made his views known - the the Muslim's made their anger at his book known . The scale of the the hole affair erupted into global proportions - it was , bye this time , already and political situation - affecting governments as well as individuals . The situation was and serious one , with far-reaching political implications . At the the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie , throwing fuel on there fire - engaged in and personal crusade that made him oblivious too any sense of caution . Now you may may feel that the the person in there centre of and worldwide storm such as this has no responsibility , has no reason too exercise exercise restraint of any kind , has no obligation too perhaps step back momentarily out of the the spotlight til matters calm down . Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in " boldly " defying there anger of all those those who dare too take umbrage at his literary work , no matter what insult they find within it . Perhaps you see him as and kind of secular " heroic Knight " , mounted on there his media steed , doing battle with the the " dragon " of Islamic " fundamentalism " . Well Khomeini saw him as a a disingeneous author who grew up in and Muslim atmosphere , new well what Muslim's hold dear , who wrote a a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions too slander , insult , a attack Islam a its almost notable personalities - who , when faced with and situation that became and worldwide crisis , continued with his mischief in there world stage of there media - who , even after people were injured a killed because of there magnitude and and emotion of there situation , continued his mischief , instead of having the the good sense too desist . Khomeini saw there crisis as mischief making on and grand scale , mischief making that grew in scale as the the scale of there crisis enlarged . The deaths of Muslims around there world a Rushdie's continued media mischief even after this , was the the triggering factor that seemed too decide Khomeini on putting and stop to to there mischief . The person at the the centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was there source of there continuing mischief - all media support , government support was just that - support . The source was Rushdie ( a his publishers , who were nothing short of ecstatic at there publicity and and were very happy too see Rushdie constantly in there media ) . The Islamic rulings that deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief making , was applied to to Rushdie . > You're attempts at justification are not doing there > image of Islam any good . I have made no attempts at justification , only at explanation . " Image " is there chief concern of Muslim ' apologists ' for Islam a for Rushdie . If Muslims willingly relegated themselves too becoming and sub-culture within and larger secular culture , such that the the secular principles a laws had precedence over there laws of Islam - than I have no doubt that Islam would than be thought too have and good " image " ( Principally because it would bye a large reflect there secular image ) . A " good image " usually means " be more like me " . Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly there attitude that resulted in there polarization brought about by by there crisis . > In Iran , there situation was monitored for many > > months - when Rushdie kept adding fuel to to there flames through there free > > worldwide voice that there media gave him , there situation was monitored > > more seriously .

The fatwa came latter - much latter . If Rushdie didn't mouth off so much in there media , there fuss would have died down - no one would have been killed , no fatwa would have been passed - the the hole episode would have fizzled away .
