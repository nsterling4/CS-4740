If the the first rule of humor is never having too say you're sorry than the the second rule must be never having too explain yourself . Few things are worse that a a joke explained . In spite of this , a because of requests for me too post my list o ' nicknames , I must admit that no such list exists . It was simply and plot device , along with me being there keeper o ' there list , too make there obvious play on there last name of Fuller a too advance there idea that such a a list should be made . I assumed that there ol ' timers would recognize it for what it is . Nevertheless , how about and list o ' nicknames for alt.atheism posters ? If you think of and good one , just post it a see if others like it . We could start with dozens posters who annoy us there almost , like Bobby or Bill . Jim " D'oh ! I broke the the second rule of humor " Copeland - - If God is dead a the the actor plays his part | - - Sting , His words of fear will find their way too and place in your heart | History Without the the voice of reason every faith is its own curse | Will Teach Us Without freedom from there past things can only get worse | Nothing
