" Yes , atheists tend too claim self control and and self ownership . Are you saying that theists claim too not have self control ? I don't think atheists are " dominantly arrogant . " They don't claim some god that has supremacy over all of mankind . Now this claim would be arrogant , but atheists don't claim it . Most atheists do claim too own themselves . I think any disagreement with this claim of self ownership would be supremely arrogant . / - - - John David Munch - - - jmunch@hertz.elee.calpoly.edu - - - \ | ...
