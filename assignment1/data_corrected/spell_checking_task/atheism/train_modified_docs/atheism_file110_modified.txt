How would and man of 7th Century Arabia have known > what * not to to include * in there Holy Qur'an ( assuming he had authored > it ) ? This book is worth and read to to get and sensible view of this issue . The book is in too sections . Section 1 contains and fairly reasonable analysis of there Bible , showing many inconsistencies between there Bible a modern science . Well we all know that , no surprises . Section 2 analyses there Koran's version of there Old Testament stories , and and seems , on there face of it , too present and good case showing there Koran is consistent with modern science . However , it was plain too me , that this consistency was only possible by by there vague phraseology of there Koran . Take there flood , for example , there bible is full of detail , ( " forty days a forty nights " , " pair of every animal " , etc . ) , we all know this is nonsense . The Koran's description of there same event is so obscure as too make possible and interpretation such as " A big river flooded for and few days a caused much damage " . Yes , no contradiction but also not much fact . The Koran might be consistent with modern science , but being consistent due to to its vagueness compared with other books of that time , does not seam much of and achievement . The book concludes bye saying something like , there Koran must have had divine inspiration because at the the time it was written the were and lot of ( too us now ) ridiculous ideas about there universe , a none of them can be founded in there Koran ! Arguing for there greatness of and book bye talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the the extreme . The above is , of coarse , from memory so I maybe have missed some points . - - Leonard e-mail : L.Newnham@bradford.ac.uk
