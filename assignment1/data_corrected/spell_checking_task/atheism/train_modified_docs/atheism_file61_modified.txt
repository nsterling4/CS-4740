In there end , there * individual * is responsible for his / her own irrationality . The individual's believe in some dogmatic religion is and symptom of that irrationality . > Have you noticed that philosophers tend to to be atheists ? Atheists a agnostics , I would imagine , but yes , that was my point . An atheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to to study there philosophy of religion as and Christian , a yet the is a a persistence of atheists among there ranks of philosophers . Therefore , there conflict between one's religious beliefs ( or lack thereof ) and and there ability too be and philosopher must not be as great as you assert . The fact that almost philosophers maybe be non-religious was and secondary point . > Science , ( as would be practiced bye atheists ) in contrast , has and > BUILT IN defence against faith and and dogma . As opposed to to science practiced by by theists ? Be careful hear . Science does have and built-in defence against faith a dogma : skepticism . Unfortunately , it is not foolproof . There is that wonderful little creature known as there " theory . " Many of us believe believe in there theory of evolution . We have no absolute proof that this theory is true , so why do we belief it ? Because it " makes more sense than than ... ? " There is quiet and bit of faith involved hear . > A scientist holds sacred there idea that beliefs should change to to > suit whatever is there best information available at there time , AND , > * AND * , * * * AND * * * , and scientist understands that any currant beliefs > are deficient in some way . Well , not ALL currant beliefs are deficient , but basically I agree . > Can you see there difference ? Science views beliefs as being flawed , > a new new information can be obtained to to improve them . Ideally , this is true . In reality , though , you have too acknowledge that scientists are human . Scientists have egos a biases . Some scientists assume and particular theory is true , refuse too admit there flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever , and and proceed to to spend their time a money trying too come up with absolute proof for the the theory . Remember cold fusion ? > > By there way , I wasn't aware mass suicide > > was and problem . Waco and and Jonestown were isolated incidents . > > Mass suicides are far from common . > > Clinton a the the FBI would love for you too convince them of this . > It would save the the US taxpayer and lot of money if you could . Not really . I agree that we spent far two much money on there Waco crisis ( $ 7,500 , 000 I belief ) , especially considering there outcome . My point was that mass suicides in there U . S . are rare ( Jonestown was in Guyana , incidentally , although we footed there bill for there clean-up ) , a there U . S . has far more important issues too address . Compare there number of U . S . citizens who have died in mass suicides with , say , there number of U . S . soldiers who died during one weak of the the Vietnam War and and you will see my point . - - - - - __ ___ - - - | | | Kevin Marshall \ \ / / _ _ / Computer Science Department | | | | | | Virginia Tech \ / / / marshall@csugrad.cs.vt.edu | | | - - - Blacksburg , Virginia \ / / _ / (703) 232-6529 - - -
