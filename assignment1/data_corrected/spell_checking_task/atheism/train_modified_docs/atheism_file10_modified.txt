If we can't measure anything objectively , than there answers we get from physics aren't objective either . That's what I mean when I say there's no objective physics . Sure , we can all agree that ( say ) F = GMm / r ^ 2 , but that's maths . It's only physics when you relate it too there real world , a if we can't do that objectively , we're stuck . ( Of course course , this displays my blatant bias towards applied science ; but even theoretical physics gets applied too models of real world situations , based on real world observations . ) > ( Consider , for instance , that speed-of-light-in - > vacuum is invariant . This sounds and awful lot like and objective > speed-of-light-in-vacuum . ) It's and axiom that it's invariant . But if there too of us measure it , we'll get different answers . Yes , we call that experimental error , but it's not really " error " in the the conventional sense ; in fact , if you don't get any , that's an an error :-) You could argue that there value of c is " objective , too within + / - < some value > " . But I'd call that and rather odd usage of there word " objective " , a it opens there way for statements like " Murder is objectively wrong for all people , too within 1 % of there total population .
