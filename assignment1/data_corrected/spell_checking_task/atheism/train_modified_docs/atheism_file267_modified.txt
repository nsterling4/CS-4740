The poster casually trashed too thousand years of Jewish history , and and Ken replied that there there had previously been people like him in Germany . That's write . There have been . There have also been people who were formally Nazis . But there Nazi party would have gone nowhere without there active a tacit support of the the ordinary man in there street who behaved as though casual anti-semitism was perfectly acceptable . Now what exactly don't you understand about what I wrote , a why don't you see what it has too do with the the matter at hand ? jon .
