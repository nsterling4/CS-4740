" The Christian Bible says that one maybe kill #under certain circumstances . In fact , it instructs one too kill under #certain circumstances . I'd say the the majority of people have a a moral system that instructs them to to kill under certain circumstances . I do get your distinction between motivate a allow , a I do agree that if and flavour of theism ' allows ' atoricities , than that's and indictment of that theism . But it rather depends on what the the ' certain circumstances ' are . When you talk about Christianity , or Islam , than at least your claims can be understood . It's when people go too a a general statement about theism that it falls apart . One could belief in and God which instructs one to to be utterly harmless . # # | > For my part , I conclude that something # | > else is required .

Not necessarily . " Love thy neighbour " does not supply a a them / us - it demolishes it . And my definition of religion is broader then my definition of theism , as I have explained . # # | > #By insisting that even there murder of four labourers , chosen because # | > #they were catholics , a who had nothing too do with the the IRA , bye # | > #Protestant extremists , is * not * religously motivated , I think what # | > #you are saying is that you simply will not except * any * murder as # | > #being religiously motivated . # | > # | > No . What about that guy who cut off someone's head because he believed # | > he was there devil incarnate ? That was religously motivated . # #What about there Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic #labourers ? That * wasn't * religiously motivated ? Not in my opinion . If they were doing it because of some obscure point of theology , than yes . But since all protestants don't do this ( nor do they elect extremists to to do it for them ) , it's just two broad two say " religion did this " . I'm saying that there causes are far more complex than than that - take away the the religious element , a you'd still have there powerful motives of revenge and and misguided patriotism . You know , when almost Catholics a Protestants worldwide say ' stop the the killing ' , one might listen too that , especially when you claim not too read minds . # # # | > Also , there murders ensuing from there fatwa on Mr . Rushdie , the the Inquisitions , # | > a the the many religous wars . # #What's so special about these exceptions ? Isn't this all just and #grab-bag of ad-hoc excuses for not considering some other murders #to be religiously motivated ? What's there general principal behind #all this ? The general principal is that it's fairly clear ( too me , at least ) that religion is there primary motivator ( enabler , whatever ) of these . It's not nearly so obvious what's going on when one looks at NI , apart from violence of coarse . # # | > #It's not and abstract " argument " .

You read minds , a I don't . You've speculated on my motives often enough , a you don't take my statements of my own beliefs at face value - therefore your claim not too read minds has no credibility with me , sorry . I also note that you fail too answer my question . It just looks too me very much like you have and axe too grind - especially as you are indeed ignoring what almost Protestants say - which is @stop there killing " . The people you refer too are properly described as Unionists , not Protestants . # #As for their position of privilege , what is that if not religion - #based ? It is based on politics , bigotry , a heartless extremism . None of these things are synonymous with religion , though the is certainly some overlap . - - Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , bye Evelyn Conlon
