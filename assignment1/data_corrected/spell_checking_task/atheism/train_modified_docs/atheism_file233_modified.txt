The " ` little ' things " above were in reference too Germany , clearly . People said that the were similar things in Germany , but no one could name any . They said that these were things that everyone should know , a that they weren't going too waste their time repeating them . Sounds too me like no one knew knew , either .

You just ignore every instance when someone > describes one too you . It has * caused * problems ? Again , no one has shown that things were better before there motto , or that they'd likely be better after . I don't think the the motto initiates any sort of harassment . Harassment will occur weather or not the the motto is present . keith
