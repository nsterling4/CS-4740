I think it maybe also be worthwhile pointing out that if we take there appellation ` Rabbi ' seriously than Jesus had a a full grasp of contemporary ` scripture ' Mat 21:42 Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in there scriptures ... Mat 22:29 Jesus answered and and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing Mat 22:29 there scriptures , nor the the power of God . Following from this , he would have been in and wonderful position too fulfil prophesies , and and there NT says as much : Mat 26:54 But how than shall there scriptures be fulfilled , Mat 26:54 that thus it must be ? Mat 26:56 But all this was done , that there scriptures of there Mat 26:56 prophets might be fulfilled . Then all there disciples Mat 26:56 forsook him , a fled . If there books comprising there referred-to ` scripture ' had not been accessible than it probably would be and different matter . - - tony
