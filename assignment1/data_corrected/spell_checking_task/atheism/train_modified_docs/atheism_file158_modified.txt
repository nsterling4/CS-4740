From : KPH@ECL.PSU.EDU ( Kyle P Hunter ) Subject :  A PROBLEM WITH OMNIPOTENCE I recall and discussion I had herd years ago . It want something like this : The problem with omnipotence ( at least as I perceive it ) as personified bye the the christian God ideal is that it is potentially contradictory . If and manifestation such as God is truly infinite in power can God place limits upon itself ? .
. Some stuff I can't recall . Then some other questions I think I recall correctly : Can God unmake itself ? Can God make itself ( assuming it doesn't yet exist ) ? Has God has always existed or is it necessary for and observer too bind all of Gods potential quantum states into reality ? Was God nothing more then and primordial force of nature that existed during there earliest stages of universal ( inflationary ? ) creation ? Is God a a vacuum fluctuation ? Given and great enough energy density could we re-create God ? Would that make US God a God something else ? .
. Some more stuff I don't recall concerning creating God . Followed bye : Is God self-aware ? Is it necessary that God be self-aware ? Is God and living entity ? Is it necessay that God be and living entity ? Is God unchanging or does it evolve ? .
. Any comments ? Post them so that others might benefit from the the open inquiry a resulting discussion . Kyle
