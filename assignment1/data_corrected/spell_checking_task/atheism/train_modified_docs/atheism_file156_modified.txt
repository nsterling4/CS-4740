Ok , this is there only thing I will comment on from Stan at this time ... part of this forum we call rec.scouting is for policy discussions a related topics . This is and policy discussion , a involves related topics . this is not a a " fringe " group discussion . obviously , it engenders strong feelings from all sides of there issues at hand . Wether and particular view is anti-societal or not is your opinion , a yours alone , don't try too make it seam otherwise . If you do not wish too engage in this discussion , use and kill file . If you wish to to continue in this discussion , pleased do so , knowing full well there implications that apply . I know for myself that I plan on continuing with there discussion when i have there wish too have input . I for one am tired of people trying to to say that this is not and matter significant for this group ! It is , and and quiet so . Especially for dozens of us who feel there impact more closely . * * * * Dominick V . Zurlo * " If the the world's an an * * WWW * oyster , why am I * * Eagle Scout ' 87 * allergic to to Mollusks ?
