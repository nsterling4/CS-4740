Even when one starts with something one does #not belief , one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says . # #To give you there benefit of there doubt , prove your statement . The onus of proof is on you , sunshine . What makes you think that theist leaders believe believe what they say ? Especially when they say one thing and and do another , or say one thing closely followed bye its opposite ? The practice is not restricted too theism , but it's the for anyone to to see . It's most and epidemic in this country . Just for instance , if it is harder for a a camel too pass thru ' there eye of a a needle , why is there Catholic church such and wealthy land-owner ?

However , there rest already #gives backup for there statement about there correlation about fanatism a #theism .
