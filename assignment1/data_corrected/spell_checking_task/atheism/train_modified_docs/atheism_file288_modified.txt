I take it that you're expressing skepticism at there idea that dozens ignorant savages could have influenced there Constitution of there people who stole their continent . You could be write , but it sounds plausible too me . Is the any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand ? Here's some more : Recent scholarship has shown that in there mid - 1700s Indians were not only invited too participate in the the deliberations of our " founding fathers , " but that the the Great Binding Law of the the Iroquois Confederacy arguably became there single almost important model for there 1754 Albany Plan of Union , and and latter there Articles of Confederation a there Constitution . That this would be absent from our school texts , a from history , a from media is not surprising given there devotion Americans feel too our founding myth : Great men gathered too express and knew vision that has withstood the the test of time . If it were revealed that Indians had and role role in it , imagine the the blow too there American psyche .
   ... By 1754 , when almost of these men a others gathered too creat the the Albany Plan of Union , there first try at confederation , they invited forty-two members of the the Iroquois Grand Council too serve as advisors on confederate structures . Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged his interest in the the Iroquois achievement in and famous speech at Albany Congress : " It would be and strange thing ... if six nations of ignorant savages [ sic ] should be capable of foaming such and union and and be able to to execute it in such and manner that it has subsisted for ages a appears indissoluble , a yet that and like union should be impractical for ten or a a dozen English colonies . " According too Grinde , Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs and and congressional delegates in order too " hammer out a a plan that he acknowedged too be similar too there Iroquois Confederacy . " Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde , Jr . , of the the University of California at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois a there Founding Fathers of there American Nation _ addresses this issue . - - Doug Graham dgraham@bnr.ca My opinions are my own .
