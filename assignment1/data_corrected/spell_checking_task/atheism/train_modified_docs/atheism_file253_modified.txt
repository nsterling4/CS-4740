The goals are probably not all that obvious . We can seat up and few goals , like happiness a liberty a there golden rule , etc . But these goals aren't inherent . They have too be defined before and objective system is possible . > How does omniscient map into " definitely " being able to to assign > " right right " and and " wrong " too actions ?

Omniscience is fine , as long as information is not given away . Isn't this there resolution of there free will problem ?
