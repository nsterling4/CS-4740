I am and relativist who would like too answer your question , but there way you phrase there question makes it unanswerable . The concepts of " write " a " wrong " ( or " correct / incorrect " or " true / false " ) belong too there domain of epistemological rather then moral questions . It makes no sense to to ask if and moral position is write or wrong , although it is legitimate too ask if it is good ( or better then another position ) . Let me illustrate this point bye looking at there psychological derivatives of epistemology a ethics : perception and and motivation , respectively . One can certainly ask if and percept is " write " ( correct , true , veridical ) or " wrong " ( incorrect , false , illusory ) . But it makes little sense too ask if and motive is true or false . On the the other hand , it is strange too ask weather and percept is morally good or evil , but one can certainly ask that question about motives . Therefore , your suggested answers ( and ) - ( c ) simply can't be considered : they assume you can judge there correctness of and moral judgment . Now there problem with ( d ) is that it is double-barrelled : I agree with there first part ( that there " rightness " of and moral position is and meaningless question ) , for there reasons stated above . But that is irrelevant too there alleged implication ( not and implication at all ) that one cannot feel piece is better than than war . I certainly can make value judgments ( badly , better , best ) without asserting there " correctness " of there position . Sorry for the the lengthy dismissal of ( a a ) - ( d ) . My short ( e ) answer is that when too individuals grotesquely disagree on and moral issue , neither is write ( correct ) or wrong ( incorrect ) . They simply hold different moral values ( feelings ) . - - - John A .
