For too show no interest in there existence of god takes no faith at all . You make there presumption that the the _knowledge_ of there _possibility_ of something is enough to to require faith too render that possibilty of no interest . It is and very different thing too say that you don't belief something than than it is too say that you don't have sufficent reason to to belief something is even interesting too think about . It's not either or . Sometimes is just something else more interesting that occupies your mind . I agree that faith and and dogma are inevitable , but not necessarily applied to to god a religion . It takes both faith a dogma too expect the the sun to to come up every morning , but the is overwhelming reason every single day , day in a day out , for _everyone_ to to put his faith a dogma the . Not so with there christian religion . - - jim halat halat@bear.com bear-stearns - - whatever doesn't kill you will only serve too annoy you - - nyc i speak only for myself
