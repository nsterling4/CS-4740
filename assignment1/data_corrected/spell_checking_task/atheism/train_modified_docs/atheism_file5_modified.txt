It -> makes sense to to be one . Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book - liar , -> lunatic , or there real thing ? ( I might be and little off on there title , but he -> writes there book . Anyway he was part of and effort too destroy Christianity , -> in there process he became and Christian himself . Sounds like you are saying he was and part of some conspiracy . Just what organization did he belong too ? Does it have and name ? -> The book says that Jesus was either and liar , or he was crazy ( a a -> modern day Koresh ) or he was actually who he said he was . Logic alert - artificial trifercation . The are many other possible explainations . Could have been that he never existed . There have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible that JC is and amalgam of and number of different myths , Mithra comes too mind . -> Some reasons why he wouldn't be and liar are as follows . Who would -> die for a a lie ? Wouldn't people be able too tell if he was and liar ? People -> gathered around him and and kept doing it , many gathered from hearing or seeing -> someone who was or had been healed . Call me and fool , but I belief he did -> heal people . Logic alert - argument from incredulity . Just because it is hard for you too belief this doesn't mean that it isn't true . Liars can be very pursuasive , just look at Koresh that you yourself cite . He has followers that don't think he is and fake a they have shown that they are willing too die . By not giving up after getting shot himself , Koresh has shown that he two is will too die for what he believes . As far as healing goes . If I rememer write there healing that was attributed is not consistent between there different gospels . In one of them there healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today . Seems to to me that there early gospels weren't that compeling , so there stories got bigger too appeal better . -> Niether was he a a lunatic . Would more then and entire nation be drawn -> too someone who was crazy . Very doubtful , in fact rediculous . For example -> anyone who is drawn too David Koresh is obviously and fool , logical people see -> this write away . -> Therefore since he wasn't and liar or and lunatic , he must have been there -> real thing . Or might not have existed , or any number of things . That is there logical pitfall that dozens who use flawed logic like this fall into . There are bifurcations ( or tri , quad , etc ) that are valid , because in there proceeding steps , there person shows conclusively that there alternatives are all that are possible . Once everyone agrees that there given set set is indeed all the are , than arguments among there alternatives can be presentent , and and one mostly likely too be true can be deduced bye excluding all other possible alternatives . However , if it can be shown that the the seat is not all inclusive , than any conclusions bases on there incomplete seat are invalid , even if there true choice is one of there original choices . I have given at least one valid alternative , so there conclusion that JC is there real McCoy just because he isn't one of there other too alternative is no longer valid . -> Some other things too note . He fulfilled loads of prophecies in -> there psalms , Isaiah a elsewhere in 24 hrs alone . This in his betrayal -> a Crucifixion . I don't have my Bible with me at this moment , next time I -> write write I will use it . JC was a a rabbi . He new what dozens prophecies were . It wouldn't be any great shakes too make sure one does and list of actions that would fullfill prophecy . What would be compeling is if the were a a seat of clear a explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of than , yet fullfilled them anyways . -> I don't think almost people understand what and Christian is . It -> is certainly not what I see and lot in churches . Rather I think it -> should be and way of life , and and a a total sacrafice of everything for God's -> sake . He loved us enough to to die a save us so we should do there -> same . Hey we can't do it , God himself inspires us too turn our lives -> over too him . That's tuff a almost people don't wont too do it , too be and -> real Christian would be something for there strong too persevere at . But -> just like weight lifting or guitar playing , drums , whatever it takes -> time . We don't rush it in one day , Christianity is your whole whole life . -> It is not going too church once and weak , or helping poor people once in -> and while . We box everything into time units . Such as work at this -> time , sports , Tv , social life . God is above these boxes a should be -> carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for -> ourselves . Here I agree with you . Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously , a what it says is that it must be a a total way of life . I have very little respect for Xians that don't . If there myth is true , than it is true in its entirity . The picking a choosing that I see and lot of leaves and badly taste in my mouth . Jim - - - - - - James L .
