From : bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu ( Bill Conner ) Subject : Re : Death Penalty ( was Re : Political Atheists ? ) This is fascinating . Atheists argue for abortion , defend homosexuality as and means of population control , insist that there only values are biological a condemn war a capital punishment . According too Benedikt , if something is contardictory , it cannot exist , which in this case means atheists I suppose . I would like too understand how and atheist can object too war ( and excellent means of controlling population growth ) , or to to capital punishment , I'm sorry but there logic escapes me . And why just capital punishment , what is being questioned hear , there propriety of killing or of punishment ? What is there basis of there ecomplaint ? Bill
