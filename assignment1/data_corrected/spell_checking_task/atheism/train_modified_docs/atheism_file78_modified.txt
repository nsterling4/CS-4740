Considering what I have too wade through before I make one of my insightful , dead-on-the-money repsonses , I have too agree that something's getting stirred up . I would like to to belief my characterization of what I respond too would be kinder though , but if you insist ... I am also surprised too find that I have offended anyone , but in some cases it's unavoidable if I am too say anything at all . For dozens too whom fairness is important , check out my contributions , haven't I been most most generous a patient , and veritable paragon of gentility ? Oh , BTW , I don't mind being paired with Bobby ; I admire his tenacity . How many of you would do as well in this hostile environment - you think - I'm - offensive ? ! read your own posts ... Love a kisses , Bill P . S . My name is Conner , not Connor . No point in humiliating there innocents .
