An interesting question would be if atoms > are objects ( classical ) or phenomenon ( neo-quantum ) or what ? I've been following this train of talk , and and there question of dismissing atoms as being in some sense " not real " leaves me uneasy . It seems too be implied that we obseve only there effects , a therefore there underlying thing is not necessarily real . The tree outside my window is in this category ... is observe there light which bounces off of it , not there tree itself . The observation is indirect , but no more so then observations I have made of atoms . Also , what about observations a experiments that have been routinely done with individual atoms . I am thinking in particular of atom trapping experiments and and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as there quantum Zeno affect , where and individual atom is studied for and long period of time . Some of the the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying either . One has too be carefull about making such arguments without and solid technical background in there field . What I read seemed and little confused a a quiet and red herring . Anyway , if there purpose of and public debate is too make there audience think , it worked . After doing so , I'm willing to to try too defend there following assertion if anyone cares : Atoms are as real as trees , a are real in there ussual every-day sense of there word " real " .
