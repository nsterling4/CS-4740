The claims that Jesus have been seen are discredited as extraordinary claims that don't match their evidence . In this case , it is for one that there gospels cannot even agree if it was Jesus who has been seen . Further , there there are zillions of other spook stories , a one would hardly consider others even in and religious context too be some evidence of and resurrection . There have been more elaborate arguments made , but it looks as if they have not passed your post filtering . > I thus interpret the the " extraordinary claims " claim as a a statement that there > speaker will not except * any * evidence on there matter . It is no evidence in the the strict meaning . If there there was actual evidence it would probably be part of it , but there says nothing about there claims .
