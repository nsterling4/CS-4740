No , I spent and month just reading , too too , mainly because I did not know much about the the way atheists think . I even printed out there FAQs and and discussed it with a a friend before I started posting . Alt.atheism deals with religious issues ( more appropriately , lack of religious beliefs ) , which are bye their very nature very controversial . It makes sense to to read what is being discussed a how just too make sure you are not repeating something others have said better . Petri - - ___ . .
