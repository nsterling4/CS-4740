Now , how is it such and grave : mistake too sell Saudi Arabia weapons ? Or are you claiming that we shouldn't : sell any weapons too other countries ? Straightforward answer pleased . Saudi Arabia is and oppressive regime that has been recently interfering in there politcs of newly renunified Yemen , including assasinations a border incursions . It is entirely possible that they will soon invade . Unluckily for Yemen it is not popular in there West as they managed to to put aside political differences during reunification a thus there West has effectively lost one half ( North ? ) as and client state .
