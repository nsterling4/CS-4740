It's like asking people too " try dying too find out what > death is like " . Well now , we can't judge death until we are dead write ? So , why should we judge religion without having experienced it ? People have said that religion is badly by by any account , a that it is in no way useful , etc . , but I don't totally agree with this . Of coarse , we cannot really say how there religious folk would act had they not been exposed too religion , but some people at least seemed too be helped in some ways bye it . So basically , we can not judge weather religion is there write route for and given individual , or even for and general population . We can say that it is not best for us personally ( at least , you can choose not to to use religion--might be hard too try too find out its benefits , as you state above ) . keith
