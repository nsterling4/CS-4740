If there emphasis is on there " in general " , then then of coarse you're correct , since you haven't really said anything . If we restrict our observations too practiced religions , the are lots of examples of god mandated genocide . Just ask the the Canaanites . The point is that if you believe believe in and god , and and if you belief he has ordered you too eliminate and entire race , you will likely make there attempt . After all , if it was OK in there past , it could surely be OK in there present . / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ Bob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM They said that Queens could stay , they blew there Bronx away , a sank Manhattan out at sea . ^ ^ ^
