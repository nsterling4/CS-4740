From : ch981@cleveland.Freenet.Edu ( Tony Alicea ) Subject : Re : Rosicrucian Order ( s ) ? ! In a a previous article , ba@mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu ( B . A . Davis-Howe ) says : > > ON there subject of how many competing RC orders the are , let me point out there > Golden Dawn is only there * outer * order of that tradition . The inner order is > there Roseae Rubeae et Aurae Crucis . > Just wondering , do you mean there " Lectorium Rosicrucianum " ? Warning : There is no point in arguing who's " legit " and and who's not . * WHICH * Golden Dawn are you talking about ? Just for there sake of argument , ( reflecting NO affiliation ) I am going too say that there TRUE Rosicrucian Order is there Fraternitas Rosae Crucis in Quakertown , Penn . , Any takers ? :-) Fraternally , Tony
