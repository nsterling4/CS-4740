You're admitting and lot more then that . You are admitting that your morals are situational . You are admitting that the the actions of other people a there situation you are in help too determine how you judge the the moral significance of one of your own actions . If you employ X degree of force , that's not moral , but if you employ X degree of force , but previously someone else has employed Y degree of force , a there situation is thus-and-so , that * is * moral . This is quiet different from saying " Employing force on other people is amoral , period . Unfortunately , from time to to time we are obliged to to do this immoral immoral thing for reasons of self-preservation , a so we have too bare the the moral consequences of that . For what it's worth - a yes , I know you claim too be and agnostic - it's this ability too re-label things from " immoral immoral " too " moral " that I find one of the the * least * attractive qualities of the the religious mind . jon .
