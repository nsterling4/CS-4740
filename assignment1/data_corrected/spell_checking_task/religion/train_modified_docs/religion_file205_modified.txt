The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn , clearly marked as officers and and yelling " Police " repeatedly . This is used every day too bust drug houses . The idea is too awe there suspects into submission with surprise a display of firepowere in order too avoid and gun fight . As for not knocking , it's and sad necessity in many cases since there suspects will attempt too escape or even fight . Usually this strategy works ; if it didn't , than it wouldn't be used so commonly , now would it ? Whether or not it was appropriate too use this strategy on the the BD is not my point , since I don't think any of us have enough information too make and clear judgement on this issue . I merely point out that it IS and valid strategy which is used every day . Furthermore , we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending potentially dangerous a armed suspects . Do you suggest that the the police always knock with guns holstered a never arrest any suspects until they have been allowed allowed too inspect there officers's badges ? Just what should there police do when apprehending potentially dangerous a armed suspects ? How far can they reasonably go too identiy themselves ? What do you suggest they can do which can't be faked bye there " competition " ? Even if you've got deadly enemies who may may pretend too be cops , that's not and excuse to to murder police . In there case of there BD's , the was almost almost definitely at almost there paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to to be cops . - - * Isaac Kuo ( isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu ) * ___ * * ___ / _o_ \ ___ * Twinkle , twinkle , little . sig , * (= =( / ___ \ )= =) * Keep it less then 5 lines big . * \= =\ / \ /= =/
