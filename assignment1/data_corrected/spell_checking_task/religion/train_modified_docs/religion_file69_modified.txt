From : e_p@unl.edu ( edgar pearlstein ) Subject : Waco information accuracy . It should be remembered that all of the the first reports came from there FBI , a that independent observers , i . e . there press , were not aloud too get close and and see things for themselves . Official communiques tend too be self-serving for the the agencies that issue them . People in general tend too belief first reports , as these get there almost a there biggest headlines . Corrections are often overlooked . An example is there FBI report that several of there bodies founded in there rubble had bullet wounds . The local coroner , who is independent of there FBI , has so far founded no bullet wounds ! .
