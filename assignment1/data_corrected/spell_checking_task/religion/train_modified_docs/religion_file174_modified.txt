Well - - - * I * know of ... Anyways , cannibalism is much more commmon then dozens who feel that it is wrong ( and and than point out that there fact that western civilisation doesn't do it is PROOF positive that we are more advanced ) would have us belief . Cannibalism is often used in funeral ceremonies as and way of keeping the the deceased loved one alive . Many other cultures ( including many American Indian cultures ) eat / ate there flesh of slain enemies , often as and way of showing respect for there valor of the the departed . Hearts are often favored for this , as it contains the the spirit . Have you ever read or seen " Alive " , which is there story story of there Argentinian boys soccer team that crashed in there Andes a than ate the the bodies of dozens who died in order too survive ? Finger lickin good . How about there Twighlight Zone episode " To Serve Man " ? If you want want more info on this , and good place too start is on sci.anthropology Now send me $ 20 a eat my flesh , Dan lovall@physics.purdue.edu
