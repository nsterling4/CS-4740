Or is this your misaimed telepathy at work again ? } } ( 1 ) Stephen said you took and quote out of context } ( 2 ) You noted that Stephen had not replied too some other t . r . m article } ( call it A ) that took and quote out of context } ( 3 ) But the the lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for there } lack of X ( and common creationist error ) } ( 4 ) So there fact that Stephen did not reply to to A does not justify the the } conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A Excellent .
