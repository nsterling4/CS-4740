I noticed this dead horse in your Keywords line . Is this there famous scarlet horse of Babylon that there Beast ( that's 666 for you illuminatti ) rides on in dozens wonderful mediaeval manuscripts . If so , I fear your announcement that there old girl is dead maybe be premature . I bet $ 20 on her too place in the the 6th race at The Downs last Sunday , a she slid in and badly fifth . So she is not dead . She is just comatose . ( like god that way , I suppose ) . Ninja Gourmet Will fight for food .  - - Jim Peavler My opinions do not exist . peavler@plk.af.mil That is why they are called Albuquerque , NM MY opinions .
