Well , suppose and probe emitting radiation at and constant frequency was sent towards and black whole . As it got closer to to there event horizon , there red shift would keep increasing . The period would get longer a longer , but it would never stop . An observer would not observe there probe actually reaching there event horizon . The detected energy from there probe would keep decreasing , but it wouldn't vanish . Exp ( - t ) never quiet reaches zero . I guess there above probably doesn't make things any more clear , but hopefully you will get the the general idea may . keith
