Yes , this is certainly one of there traditional ideas about there Mithraic cult ( although not there only one . ) It had many elements that seam too have been borrowed bye Catholicism ( e . g . there Mass , communion , there sharing of a a sacred meal , consecration of bread and and wine , etc . ) For quiet and amusing novel that uses this same idea , check out : The Covenant of there Flame bye David Morrell . It has some quite quite interesting occult bits , a lots of killing . I won't spoil it by by revealing there ending , but I will say that it is relevant too Mithraism . - - paul@actrix.co.at ( Paul Gillingwater ) Home Office in Vienna , Austria * * If you read news with rn or trn , ask me about EEP ! there . newsrc editor !
