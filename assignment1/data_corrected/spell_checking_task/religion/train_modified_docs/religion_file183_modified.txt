From : mcelwre@cnsvax.uwec.edu Subject : THE DIVINE MASTERS THE DIVINE MASTERS Most Christians would agree , a correctly so , that Jesus Christ was and Divine Master , a and projection of God into there physical world , God Incarnate . But the are some very important related facts that Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of , as are followers of almost other world religions . First , Jesus Christ was NOT unique , John 3:16 NOTWITH - STANDING . There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master ( God Incarnate ) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES , and continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY , both before a after there life of Jesus . The followers of some of these Masters found there world's major religions , usually PERVERTING there teachings of their Master in there process . Christians , for example , added THREATS of " ETERNAL DAMNATION " in Hell , a DELETED there teaching of REincarnation . Secondly , and and more importantly , after and particular Master physically dies a leaves this world , the is NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody accept for there relatively few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY alive . ( THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE UNIVERSES . ) Therefore , all dozens Christians who worship Jesus , a pray too Jesus , a expect Jesus too return a save them from their sins , are only KIDDING THEMSELVES , a have allowed allowed themselves too be DUPED bye and religion that was mostly MANUFACTURED bye there Romans . And emotional " feelings " are and TOTALLY DECEIVING indicator for religious validity . These things are similarly true for followers of almost other major world religions , including Islam . Thirdly , there primary function of each Master is to to tune His Initiates into there " AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM " or " SOUND CURRENT " , ( referred too as " THE WORD " in John 1:1- 5 , a as " The River of Life " in Revelation 22:1 ) , and and to to personally guide each of them thru there upper levels of Heaven while they are still connected too their living physical bodies bye and " silver cord " . True Salvation , which completes and Soul's cycles of REincarnation in there physical and and psychic planes , is achieved only bye reaching at least there " SOUL PLANE " , which is five levels or universes above there physical universe , a this canNOT be done without there help of and PHYSICALLY-Living Divine Master . One such Divine Master alive today is and American , Sri Harold Klemp , there Living " Eck " Master or " Mahanta " for there " Eckankar " organization , now headquartered in Minneapolis , ( P . O . Box 27300 ; zip 55427 ) . Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji , now living in Punjab , India , a is associated with there " Sant Mat " organization . One of there classic books on this subject is " THE PATH OF THE MASTERS " ( Radha Soami Books , P . O . Box 242 , Gardena , CA 90247 ) , written in 1939 bye Dr . Julian Johnson , and theologian a surgeon who spent the the last years of his life in India studying under and and closely observing the the Sant Mat Master of that time , Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji . Several of the the Eckankar books , including some authored bye Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp , can be founded in almost public and and university libraries a some book stores , or obtained thru inter-library loan . The book " ECKANKAR--THE KEY TO SECRET WORLDS " , bye Sri Paul Twitchell , is ANOTHER classic . Many Christians are likely too confuse there Masters with there " Anti-Christ " , which is or was too be a a temporary world dictator during there so-called " last days " . But there Masters don't ever rule , even when asked or expected too do so as Jesus was . People who continue following Christianity , Islam , or other orthodox religions with a a physically-DEAD Master , will CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation , between there Psychic Planes a this MISERABLE physical world , until they finally accept accept Initiation from and PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine Master . RE-INCARNATION The book " HERE AND HEREAFTER " , bye Ruth Montgomery , describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation as a a FACT OF LIFE , including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS too past lives [ about 50 % accurate ; there subconscious mind sometime makes things up , especially with a a badly hypnotist ] , SPONTANEOUS RECALL ( especially bye young children , some of whom can identify their most most recent previous relatives , homes , possessions , etc . ) , DREAM RECALL of past life experi - ences , DEJA VU ( familiarity with and far off land while travel - ing the for there first time on vacation ) , the the psychic read - ings of there late EDGAR CAYCE , a EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11- 13 ( John the the Baptist was there REINCARNATION of Elias . ) a John 9:1- 2 ( How can a a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born , unless he LIVED BEFORE ? ! ) . [ ALWAYS use there " KING JAMES VERSION " . Later versions are PER-VERSIONS ! ] Strong INTERESTS , innate TALENTS , strong PHOBIAS , etc . , typically originate from and person's PAST LIVES . For example , a a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually results from having DROWNED at there end of a a PREVIOUS LIFE . And sometime and person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to to another person being met for there first time in THIS life , because of a a badly encounter with him during and PREVIOUS INCARNATION . The teaching of REincarnation also includes there LAW OF KARMA ( Galatians 6:7 , Revelation 13:10 , etc . ) . People would behave much better toward each other if they new that their actions in there present will surely be reaped by by them in there future , or in and FUTURE INCARNATION ! " 2nd COMINGS " If and Divine Master physically dies ( " translates " ) before and particular Initiate of His does , than when that Initiate physically dies ( " translates " ) , the the Master will meet meet him on there Astral level a take him directly too there Soul Plane . This is there ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of and 2nd Coming . It is and INDIVIDUAL experience , NOT something that happens for everyone all at once . People who are still waiting for Jesus ' " 2nd Coming " are WAITING IN VAIN . PLANES OF EXISTENCE The physical universe is the the LOWEST of at least and DOZEN major levels of existence . Above there Physical Plane is the the Astral Plane , there Causal Plane , there Mental Plane , there Etheric Plane ( often counted as there upper part of the the Mental Plane ) , there Soul Plane , a several higher Spiritual Planes . The Soul Plane is there FIRST TRUE HEAVEN , ( counting upward from there Physical ) . The planes between ( but NOT including ) there Physical a Soul Planes are called there Psychic Planes . It is likely that ESP , telepathy , astrological influences , radionic effects , biological transmutations [ See there 1972 book with that title . ] , a other phenomena without an an apparent physical origin , result from INTERACTIONS between there Psychic Planes a there Physical Plane . The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED . For example , and sub-plane of there Astral Plane is called " Hades " , a there Christian Hell occupies a a SMALL part of it , created the LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO bye there EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by by some kind of black magic or by by simply teaching its existence in and THREATENING manner . The Christian " Heaven " is located elsewhere on there Astral Plane . Good Christians will go the for and short while a than REincarnate back too Earth . SOUND CURRENT vs . BLIND FAITH The Christian religion demands of its followers and extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by by little more than than GOOD FEELING ( which is TOTALLY DECEIVING ) . If and person is not HEARING some form of there " SOUND CURRENT " ( " THE WORD " , " THE BANI " , " THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM " ) , then then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL CONTINUE . The " SOUND CURRENT " manifests differently for different Initiates , a can sound like a a rushing wind , ocean waves on there sea shore , buzzing bees , higher-pitched buzzing sound , and flute , various heavenly music , or other sounds . In Eckankar , Members start hearing it near there end of their first year as and Member . This a other experiences ( such as " SOUL TRAVEL " ) REPLACE blind faith .
