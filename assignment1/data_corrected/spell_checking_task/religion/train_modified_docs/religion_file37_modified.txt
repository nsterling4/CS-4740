From : psyrobtw@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu ( Robert Weiss ) Subject : [ lds ] Thief goes too Paradise ; Kermit goes off tangent Kermit Tensmeyer quoted from and few sources a than wrote something . I will attempt too construct and facsimile of what was previously said , a than address Kermit's offering . John Redelfs originally wrote ... jr > I learned that and man cannot frustrate justice bye repenting on his jr > death bed because repentance is more than than a a feeling of remorse . It jr > requires faith in Christ proven bye following him , by by keeping his jr > commandments . Such cannot be accomplished on ones deathbed . Tom Albrecht responded ... ta > So Jesus must have lied too there thief on there cross . John Redelfs wrote back that ... jr > Paradise a salvation are not there same thing . Salvation is better . jr > Refer too John 14:2 . I responded too John that ... rw > I don't see the the effort too equate salvation with paradise . rw > rw > Rather , I see implied there fact that only dozens who are saved rw > maybe enter paradise . To which Kermit wrote ... kt > Incomplete reference : kt > kt > See also there discussion : Did Jesus go into Hell in there BibleStudy group kt > for there arguments that Paradise a Hell ( sheol ) are laces after death kt > The discussion ( no LDS were involved as far as I could see ) argued using kt > standard Christian argument from there Bible that pretty much support the the kt > LDS position . kt > kt > Christ want to to paridise after his death a burial . kt > kt > He taught the the prisoners a freed them from Darkness . kt > kt > When he was resurrected , he had not yet ascended too his father . kt > kt > The arguement centered around what was or wasn't there proper biblical kt > terms for dozens laces . I respond . The question that was raised was not if Jesus went went to to infernal Paradise before entering into heaven . No one has made and point for or against that issue , nor have they compared the the LDS position against orthodox believe . The infernal paradise is held too be Abraham's bosom ( Luke 16 ) , there place of the the righteous dead in sheol ( equivalent too hades ) . The point that was raised by by John was that someone could not repent on their death bed . Tom Albrecht pointed to to a a Biblical example that was contradictory to to what John's position put foreword . The thief on the the cross was promised bye Christ too be with Him in Paradise , there abode of there righteous dead . John's position possibly needs to to be reworked . Kermit needs to to address there topic at hand . = = = Robert Weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu
