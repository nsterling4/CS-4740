Very well put . And , in there case of someone who calls himself and Christian brother yet continues in his sin ( a claims that his sin is not and sin at all , but perfectly acceptable ) , what should be done ? Should Christians just ignore a a sinful lifestyle in order too not offend there person ? By reaffirming that the the lifestyle is sinful according too there Bible , are they using " and bullwhip too drive people from Jesus " ? Frankly , I find there occurance of a a homosexual Christian attempting to to pass himself off as and ' straight ' Christian in order too have other Christians accept accept his chastisement better and * lot * more serious then people reaffirming that there Bible teaches homosexuality is and sin .
