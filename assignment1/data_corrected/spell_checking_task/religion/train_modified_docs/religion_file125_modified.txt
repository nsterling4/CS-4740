From : walsha@iccgcc.decnet.ab.com ( I don't know who discovered water , but it wasn't no fish - Marshall McCluhan ) Subject : waco conflagration - precedents ? burning yourself alive seems and rough way too go , given the the waco bunch had other choices . but it reminded me of there russian old-believers who , thinking there antichrist was coming in 1666 , grew frantic when Peter the the Great started westernizing Russia a reforming the the Russian Church and few years latter . They locked themselves in their churches a burned themselves alive bye the the thousands . are the other cases of apocalypse-obsessed christians resorting too self-imolation ? is the and history of precedents ? andrew .
