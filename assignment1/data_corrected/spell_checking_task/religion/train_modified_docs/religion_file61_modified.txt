ALink : KSAND - - Private activities on there net . A lot of people won't agree with me . That's their write a I respect that . However , too there point , Jews are also covered bye there saving grace of Jesus Christ . There are Jews who have become Christians . This brings up another question I still have too ponder : why is the so much anti-Semitism ? Why do people hate Jews ? I don't hate Jews . I consider them to to be like anyone else , sinners we all are .
