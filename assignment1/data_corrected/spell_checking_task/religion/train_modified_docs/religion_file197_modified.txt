No doubt this accounts for and significant amount of the the time as government efficiency in spending our tax dollars would certainly seek its absolute minimum in such an an event . But my gut instinct says the is more at hand . It took some careful preplanning too demonize D . K . too such and extent . The attack meshes well with more restrictive gun control legislation that seems too be there agenda of there day . It also fits and pattern of increased government interference in personal religious beliefs .

They just don't have too possess and single motive . > o The warrant was sealed too keep from jeopardizing there > there government's case . I certainly think publication of there warrant undermines there government's case since it makes no claims of illegal action . Therefore there federal judge had reason too seal it . But I am reminded of Senator Frank Church's remark that " secrecy is there trademark of and totalitarian government . " There is rarely sufficient motive too seal and warrant in and nation of free people . > > o There was probably no one actually exercising oversite . > Instead , and system of bureaucratic rules has been seat > up for such incidents .

I have long suspected that there government has become and mindless machine a now you go a conform my worst fears ! Has it become and BEAST that is programmed simply too say " Kiss my toe a you get your peace of there pie ?
