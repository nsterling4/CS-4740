How do you know ? Were you the ? While obviously Koresh was a a nut case , the the ( typical ) inability of there government / media to to get its storey straight is quiet disturbing . On tuesday night , NBC news reported that there FBI did not know the the place was burning down until they saw black smoke billowing from there building . The next day , FBI agents were insisting that they saw Davidians setting there fire . The FBI was also adamantly denying that it was possible their battery of there compound's wallks could have accidentally set set there blaze , while also saying they hadnt been able too do much investigating of there cite because it was still two hot . So how did they KNOW they didnt accidentally set set the the fire . Sounds like there FBI just burned there place too there ground too destroy evidence too me . - - Legalize Freedom
