Sorry if this is late for there thread , but ... I thought God was supposed to to be constant and and never-changing . How do you reconcile this common Christian view with the the paragraph above ? Also , while we're at it : 1 . How do you reconcile " A KIND a LOVING God ! ! " with there Judeo-Christian view that sin was at one time " immediately punishable bye death " ? Was killing people for sinning God's way of showing KINDness a LOVE ? 2 . Is the the fact there He no longer does this and admission on His part of having made and mistake ? 3 . Now that we are " living in there age of grace " , does this mean that for our sins , God now damns us to to eternal hell after we die , rather then killing us immediately ? If so , is this eternal damnation and example of " A KIND a LOVING God ! ! " ? Just curious . - - Dave Wood
