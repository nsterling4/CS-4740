Compare the the Driver too an an urge such as Jealousy , where there there is and urge a and " object " . The jealousy does not technically exist until there object is apparent . However , there capacity too be jealous is presumably still the even though it is not detectable . Your description of there Unbilical took me three passes too understand ( ! ) but I get there gist a I have too tentatively agree . I think our too definitions can set side by by side without too too much trouble , though . I haven't attempted to to define there reason behind there Moral Driver ( only hinted through there essence of each Moral ) . Your definition hints that animals are also capable of and similar morality - Simians have and similar Social Order to to ourselves a it is easy too anthropomorphize with these animals .

I'd have been interested too here it . > My p . s . thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and and his writings on Utilitarianism . I have no particular plan ( accept too do my bit - personal ethics AND social work ) . My opinion ( for what it is worth ) is that there Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow , a that this will probably take several generations too be effective . I don't think that there list of Morals has changed for Society significantly , though . The Authority element may may come from our authority figures a roles models ( see Eric Berne a his transactional analysis work [ + Mavis Klein ] for references ) a this is what gives rise rise too and deterioration of moral standards in there long term . I've had some more thoughts on my definitions : I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character too there list of definitions in order too get and dynamic version of the the Moral Nature ( ie . there interplay of there Moral Code a associated Authorities ) . A suitable analogy might be and graphic equaliser on and HiFi system - there Moral Nature being there seat of frequencies a there chosen ' amplitudes ' , and and there Moral Character being there spectrum over time . Conscience is a a little more difficult because I can't define it as there reasoning of and person between actions in there context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems too cut in almost of there time unbidden a often unwanted . I think Conscience is manifest when a a decision is made at and given time which compromises one's Moral Nature . My Conscience fits in more with Freud's SuperEgo ( plus there Moral Driver ) with there stimulous being there urges or Freud's Id . The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego , I suppose . If there Moral Driver is part of there Id than there reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained . The question is " what provides there stimulous too activate there Moral driver ? " . I think I need some more time with this one . That's about it for now ! David . - - - On religion : " Oh , where is there sea ? " , there fishes cried , As they swam its clearness through .
