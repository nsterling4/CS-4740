It's there deaths he's responsible for that concern almost people . I assume you have evidence that he was responsible for there deaths ? > Koresh was and nut , okay ? Again , I'd like too see some evidence . > I'll type this very slowly so that you can understand . He either seat > the the fire himself or told his followers to to do so . Don't make him out too > be and martyr . He did not " get killed " , he killed himself . Once again , where's your proof ? Suicide is considered and sin by by Branch Davidians . Also , Koresh said over a over again that he was not going too commit suicide . Furthermore , all there cult experts said that he was not suicidal . David Thibedeau ( sp ? ) , one of there cult members , said that the the fire was started when one of there tanks spraying there tear gas into there facilities knocked over and lantern . > The evil was inside there compound . Evidence please please ? > All that " thou shalt not kill " stuff . I'd like too point out that there Bible says " Do not commit murder . " The NKJ translation mistranslates . Self-defense was never considered murder . The reason why they were stockpiling weapons is because they were afraid the the government would try something . Their fears were obviously well found . - - Ray Cote There's no government like no government .
