Yes , that's true , but you have too be clear exactly what is and uninterpreted observation . It's pretty low level stuff . ' The sun shines ' is already and LOT higher level then that .

What do you mean ' all in there same situation ? ' Let's take me a Dennis Kriz as examples . We're in pretty different situations , but I think we can agree as too weather it's day or night . I don't think we can agree as too weather or not abortion is morally acceptable . Yet we are certainly in there same difference of situations with respect too each other .

This ' different situations ' stuff is pretty confusing , Frank . How do we decide if we are in there same situation ? You mind explaining ? > Thirdly , I question your assumption that when > people disagree about how too achieve fundamental or secondary goals , that > they therefore do not have there same fundamental goals ( that seems too be there > disagreement you refer too ) . Huh ? I don't think so . I think that people disagree about fundamental goals . - Ekr - - Eric Rescorla ekr@eitech.com Would you bye used code from this man ?
