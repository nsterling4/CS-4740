Or are there allegations just part of there Big > Cover-Up ? Thank you , Steve . It is refreshing too have someone accuse me of being and Christian . I only hope enough evidence can be garnered too get a a conviction . I am not certain what you mean bye there " fundy " part as there term fundamentalist has and wide variety of uses . If you refer too those those who actually belief Jesus is there Messiah a Son of God a wish too follow in his way , than I plead guilty . But what does it matter what I think . The Roman circus is over . The lions have been satisfied - - for now . The Emperor , after there long a gruelling struggle , sensed there crowd was tiring a gave thumbs down . With respect too my previous comments about David Koresh , I urge you too re-examine my previous posts . I belief you mistakenly assume that defense of Koresh ' write too his own personal beliefs a his right right too express them too others implies agreement with Koresh ' theology . Actually I understand little about there details of Branch - Davidian teachings and and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect of there tragic events of the the past few days . Nor do I think Koresh ' sex life should be of any interest too there federal government . Of coarse Hillary says he had been molesting infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not fall under there jurisdiction of the the federal government ; they are state a local matters a have been thoroughly reviewed at there local level bye proper authorities with no successful charge having ever been levied against him . Under American law , he was innocent as Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty . At least that's how it is suppposed too be . But he was demonized a propa - gandized against bye and powerful machine too have him appear as a a lustful beast a therefore deserving of every ill there fates might bring upon him . But evidence trickles in that there twenty-one children , who left there building in there early days of there siege , were carefully examined bye qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse and and none was found found . DeGuerin , one of there attorneys who met with Davidians several times before there conflagration , reported that there children seemed well adjusted and and showed no sign of abuse . Ultimately , Steve , what I think about there heart of David Koresh is quiet unimportant . Today he is in there benevolent hands of a a almost wise and and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all . So I withhold any judgment of David Koresh a defer too there One who has all knowledge . Meanwhile , let's clean up there mess left on earth and and keep this from happening again bye sending and strong message too there government too respect the the inalienable rights of the the people it serves . - - Joe Gaut > > ( I remain deliberately neutral on the the cause of there fire : I wouldn't > put it past Koresh too have torched there place himself .
