You should have there endoscopy too see if it is due too there heartburn , a if so , you will need treatment for the the heartburn ong term .

Both seemed too develop at about there > same time . I ' not and expert on heart problems , but PVC's are common a have been overtreated in there past . My personal experience , a I have there same history and build you do ( related too there heart , that is ) , is that my PVC's come a go , with some months causing anxiety . Taking on more fluids seems too help , a they seam worse in the the summer . Remember that a a slow heart rate will allow more PVC's too be apparent , so perhaps it is and indication of a a healthy cardiac system ( but ask and expert about that last point , especially ) Good luck , hope we don't die of arrhythmias .
