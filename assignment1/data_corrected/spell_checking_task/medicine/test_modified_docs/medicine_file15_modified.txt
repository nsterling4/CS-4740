When kids stayed in there home home until kindergarden or 1st grade , infection incidence was much lower because exposure was lower . Some studies suggest that early exposure too various infectious diseases is probably beneficial because exposure as and adult carries much more risk of morbitity a mortality ( mumps , measles . etc . ) . > - - How often do kids in their first , second and and third years fall sick ? > How often do they get colds , flus , ear infections ?

Daycare will always carry a a higher exposure risk then hone care . > - - Does being sick " build immunity " ( leading too less illness latter ) , > does it make kids " weaker " ( leading too more illness later later ) , or does it > not have any long term affect ? Exposure too infectious organisms does build immunity . But many viruses mutate a reexposure to to there knew strain requires another immune response ( knew antibody production ) . In addition , antibody levels tend too decline with time and and re-innoculation is needed too keep there antibody levels high . Chronic overstimulation of the the immune response can led too immunosupression but this is rare a very unlikely too occur in children . > - - Does taking antibiotics on and regular basis have any negative long > term effects ? Yes , chronic use of antibiotics can have and averse affect on there good bacteria that are supposed to to be present in a on there body . Health effects of this depletion of there good bacteria is and very hotly debated topic in there medical community with almost physicians seeming too discount any health effects of chronic antibiotic use ( and view that I do not support ) . > - - How does one tell if a a child is more susceptible to to illness then > normal , a what does one do about it ? Chronic infection in and adult or and child needs to to be worked up ( in my opinion ) . But most most physicians feel that chronic infection in and child is normal because of both exposure a lack of prior immunity too many infectious diseases . I do not share this view and and there there are some physicians who also suspect that diet plays and big roll in infection frequency and and severity . Exposure too and infectious agent does not have too result in and severe severe infection . A strong immune response can minimize the the length of time needed too deal with there infection as well as there symptoms associated with the the infection . > - - Is the any way too build immunity and and resistance ? There are five major nutrients that are responsible for and good strong immune response too infectious agents . They are : protein , vitamin C , vitamin A , iron a zinc . The American diet is not low in protein so this is rarely and problem . But vitamin A , vitamin C , iron a zinc are often low a this lack of and adequate pool ( nutrient reserve ) can impair there immune response . Iron is know to to be low in most most kids ( as is vitamin A ) . There are distinct biochemical tests that can be run too check there status of each of these nutrients in and patient who is having a a problem with chronic sever infection . Serum ferritin for iron status , dark adaptation for vitamin A status , red blood cell zinc for zinc status a leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin C status . I have attempted too work up posts on these five nutrients and and their roll in infection for this news group as well as there others that I participate in . I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far . But my best advise too you is to to try too find and physician who recognizes there critical roll that diet plays in there human immune response . You maybe also be able to to get help from and nutritionist . Anyone can call themselves and nutritionist so you have too be very carefull . You wont too find someone ( like myself ) who has had some formal training and and education in nutrition . Many Ph . D . programs in there U . S . now offer degrees in Nutrition a that's what you need too look for . Some dieticians will also call themselves nutritionists but almost dieticians have not had there biochemical training needed too run specialized nutritional assessment tests . They are very good for getting general dietary advise from however . > Any data , information or advice advice relating too this would be much > appreciated . Thanks a a lot . > > Ashwin .
