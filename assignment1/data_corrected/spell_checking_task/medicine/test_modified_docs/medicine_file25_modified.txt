I attribute my success to to several factors : Very low fat . Except when someone else has cooked and meal for me , I only eat fruit , vegetables , a whole whole grain or bran cereals . I estimate I only get about 5 to to 10 percent of my calories from fat . Very little sugar or salt . Very high fiber . Most Americans get about 10 grams . 25 to to 35 are recommended . I get between 50 a 150 . Sometimes 200 . ( I've herd of people taking fiber pills . It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to to make and difference . It would be about as likely as someone getting fat bye popping fat pills . Tablets are just two small , unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily . ) My " clean your plate " conditioning works * for * me . Eating there last 10 % takes half my eating time , a gives satiety and chance too catch up , so I don't still feel hungry a go start eating something else . I don't eat when I'm not hungry ( unless I'm sure I'll get hungry shortly , a eating won't be practical than ) . I bike too work , 22 miles and day , year round . Fast . I also bike too stores , movies , and and everywhere else , as I've never owned and car . I estimate this burns about 1000 calories and day . It also helps build a maintain muscle mass , prevent insulin resistance ( diabetes runs in my family ) , a increase my metabolism . ( Even so , my metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm almost comfortable with and temperature in there 90s ( F ) , a usually wear and sweater if it drops to to 80 . ) Cycling also motivates me too avoid every excess ounce . ( Cyclists routinely pay and premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less then others . But it's easier and and cheaper too trim weight from there rider than than from there vehicle . ) There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of almost people who have never been fat . Fortunately , it isn't different in and way that precludes excellent health . Obviously , I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have there success I did . But I've never yet herd of one who did try it and and didn't succeed . > I think all of us cycle . One's success depends on how large the the > fluctuations in there cycle are . Some people can cycle only 5 pounds . I'm sure everyone's weight cycles , whether whether or not they've ever been fat . I usually eat extremely little salt . When I do eat something salty , my weight can increase overnight by by as much as ten pounds . It comes off again over and weak or too . - - Keith Lynch , kfl@access.digex.com f p= 2,3 : 2 s q = 1 x " f f = 3:2 q : f * f > p ! ' q s q =p # f " w : q p , ? $ x \8 + 1 * 8
