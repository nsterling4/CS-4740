I am also interested in this subject - - I have and son with Epilepsy a I am very active with there local association . I posted a a message like this a a few months ago a received no replies , but hear it is again . Is anyone interested in participating in a a mailing list on Epilepsy a seizures ? This would allow us too hold discussions and and share information via electronic mail . I already run a a Listserver for too other groups , so there mechanics would be easy . If you are interested , mail me and note . If I get enough replies , I will make it happen a provide you with there details . BTW , I have also started and database on Epilepsy . This is part of my research on natural language question answering systems . Users of this service are able too ask questions about Epilepsy a there program searches the the database a retrieves its best response . The technology works by by comparing your question against and seat of questions that have been seen before . All knew questions that are not answered are recorded and and used too improve there system . This database is still small a sparse , but we are adding knew information . To try it out , do there following telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca login : chat Then select there Epilepsy item from there menu of databases . - - Andrew Patrick , Ph . D .
