" but I have zero data on it . > > What do you know ? > > - - > Henry Melton I'll tell you all that I know about chromium . But before I do , I want want too get and few things off my chest . I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney stone posts . Kidney stones are primarily caused by by diet , as is heart disease a cancer . When I give dietary advise advise , it is not intended too encourage people reading this news group ( or Sci . Med . Nutrition where I do most most of my posting ) to to avoid seeing and doctor . Nothing can be further from there truth . Kidney stones can be caused by by tumors and and this possibility has too be ruled out . But once it is , diet is and good way of preventing and reoccurance . Same thing with heart disease a cancer , if you suspect that you may may have and problem with one of these diseases , don't use what I'm going too tell you or what you read in some book too avoid going to to a a doctor . You have too go . Hopefully you will find a a doctor who knows enough about nutrition too help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of and treatment program ( but there odds are that you will not a that's why I'm here here ) . When my wife detected and lump in hear breast I didn't say , don't worry my vitamin E will take care of it . Any breast lump has too be worked up bye a a physician , plan a simple . If it's begnin ( which almost are ) fine , than may a a diet change a supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring . But let me tell you write now , if you have tried diet a supplementation a another lump returns , get your butt into there doctor's office as fast as your little feet can carry you ( better yet , have and mammography done on and regular basis , my wife kept putting her's off , both myself and and her gynocologist told her she needed too have one done ) . Her gynocologist even scheduled one , but she didn't show up ( two busy running there Operating Room for the the biggest Hospital in Tulsa ) . One more thing , I am not and orthomolecular nutritionist . This group uses high dose vitamins and and minerals to to treat all kinds of disease . There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins a minerals can a do have drug actions in the the body . But you talk about flying blind , man this is really blind treatment . No drug could ever be used as these vitamins a minerals are being used . I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't be write on there money , it may may well be . But my approach too nutrition is and lot like that of Weinsier a Morgan , the the too M . D's who wrote the the new new Clinical Nutrition textbook . My push is the the nutrient reserves a there lab tests needed too measure these reserves a than supplementation or diet changes too get these reserves built up too where they should be too let you handle stress . That's where I'm coming from folks . Blast away if you wont , I'm not going too change . Put me in your killfile if you wont , I really don't care . I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a a day from people who think that I've got something important too say . But I'm also getting hit bye and few with and axe to to grind . That's life . Chromium is one of there trace elements . It has a a very limited ( but very important ) roll in there body . It is used too form glucose tolerance factor ( GTF ) . GTF is made up of chromium , nicinamide ( niacin ) , glycine , cysteine a glutamic . Only there chromium and and the the niacin are needed from there diet to to form GTF . Some foods already have GTF ( Liver , brewers or nutritional yeast , a black pepper ) . When chromium is in GTF , and pretty good absorption is seen ( about 20 % ) . But when it is simply present as a a mineral or mineral chelate ( chromium picolinate ) it's absorption is much lower ( 1 too 2 % , lowest for all there minerals ) . I've been posting in Misc . Fitness a chromium has come up the several times as and " fat burner " . Chromium is among there least toxic of there minerals so you could really load yourself up a not really do any harm . I wouldn't do it though . The adequate a safe range for chromium is 50 to to 200ug per day . The average American is getting about 30ug per day from his / her diet . Chromium levels decrease with age a many belief that adult onset diabetes is primarily and chromium deficiency . I can site you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in Type II diabetes but I'm not going to to because for each positive one , the also seems too be and negative one as well . I'm convinced that there problem is bioavailability . When yeast ( GTF ) is used , good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used there results are usually negative . In addition to to Type II diabetes , chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and and glucoma , again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concerned Since and high blood glucose level can led too cardiovascular disease , this possible link with chromium isn't two surprising . Glucoma is and little more interesting . Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily and insulin responsive glucose-driven metabolic function . If this eye focusing activity is impaired ( bye and lack of glucose due too and poor insulin response ) , intraocular pressure is believed to to be elevated . In and fairly large study of 400 pts with glaucoma , there one consistent finding was and low RBC chromium . J . Am . Coll . Nutr . 10 ( 5 ): 536 , ( 1991 ) . But this one preliminary study should not prompt people too go out a start popping chromium supplements . For one thing , just about every older person is going to to have a a low RBC chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemnts ( yeast ) . Since glucoma is often founded in older people , it's not two surprising that chromium was low in the the RBC's . If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma , that would prompt some attention . I suspect that there there will be and clinical trail too check out this possible chromium link too glucoma . You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by by either there RBC chromium test or hair analysis . Most clinical labs are not going too run a a RBC chromium . There are plenty of labs that will do and hair a nail analysis for you , but I wouldn't use them . There is just two much funny business going on in these unregulated labs write now . Here's Weinsier a Morgan , advice on chromium . They do not consider chromium too be one of dozens minerals for which and reliable clinical test is available ( they don't like there hair a nail analysis labs either , a they also recognize there RBC chromium is primarily a a research test that is not routinely available in almost clinical chemistry labs ) . This has too change and and as more labs run and RBC chromiuum , it will . What than do they suggest ? Make a a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on and documented clinical response too chromium ( run a a glucose tolerance test before a after chromium supplementation ) . Once you make there diagnosis , put the the patient on 200ug of CrCl 3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day . What's my advice ? Don't take chromium supplements too try too lose weight ( they just do not work that way ) . If you wont too take them a then then exorcise , that would be great . Do include yeast as part of your diet ( almost Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet ) . If you do have and poor glucose tolerance , ask your doctor too check your chromium status . When he or she says , " what in the the world are you talking about " , just say , pleased get and copy of Weinsier a Morgan's new new Clinical Nutrition textbook a do what they say too do with patience who present with and poor glucose tolerance . If you can't do that , I'll find and doctor who can , thank you very much . Marty B .
