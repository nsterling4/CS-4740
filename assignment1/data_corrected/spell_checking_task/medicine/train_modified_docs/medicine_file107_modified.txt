Shades of James Watson ! That's exactly the the way many workers have described their misgivings about there Human Genome Project . If you take and rigid definition of scientific research , there mere accumulation of data is not doing science . One of there early arguments against there project were that there resources would be better used to to focus on specific genetics-related problems rather than than just going off a collecting maps a sequence . The project can't be so narrowly defined or easily described now though .
