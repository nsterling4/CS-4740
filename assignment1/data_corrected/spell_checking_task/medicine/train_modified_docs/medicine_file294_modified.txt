From : badboy@netcom.com ( Jay Keller ) Subject : Sinus Surgery / Septoplasty My ENT doctor recommended surgery too fix my sinuses . I have a a very deviated nasal septum ( probably the the result at least partially from several fractures ) . One side has approximately 10-15 % of normal flow . Of coarse I have known this for years but recently discovered that I suffer from chronic sinus infection , discovered during and MRI after and sever migraine . A CT scan subsequently confirmed the the problems in there sinuses . He wants too do endoscopic sinus surgery on there ethmoid , maxillary , frontal , a sphenoid , along with nasal septoplasty . He explained there procedure , and and there risks . What I would like too know is if there there is anyone out the who can tell me " I had this surgery , a it helped me " ? ( I've already herd from and couple who said they had it a it didn't really help them ) . I am a a moderately sever asthmatic . ENT doc says large percentage see some relief of their asthma after sinus surgery . Also he said it is not unheard of that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved . I am 42 . Any relevant information is appreciated . Regards , Jay Keller Sunnyvale , California badboy@netcom.com
