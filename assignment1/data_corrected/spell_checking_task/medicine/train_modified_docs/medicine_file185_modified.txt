If I had to to choose , I'd much > rather have there persistant type . Being a a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean there patient has chronic persistent anything . Persons who are chronic carriers maybe have no clinical , biochemical , or histologic evidence of liver disease , or they maybe have chronic persistent hepatitis , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis , or hepatocellular carcinoma . Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis ( CPH ) are probably there result of and viral infection , although in and good number of cases there cause cannot be determined . The diagnosis of CPH is made on the the basis of liver biopsy . It consists of findings of portal inflammation , an an intact periportal limiting plate , a on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis . But in contrast too chronic active hepatitis ( CAH ) the is no periportal inflammation , bridging necrosis , or fibrosis . CPH has , indeed , and excellent prognosis . If I had to to choose between CAH a CPH the is no question I would also choose CPH . However , as David pointed out , there distinction between the the too is not as neat as some of us would have it . The histology can sometime be pretty equivocal , with biopsies showing areas compatible with both CPH and and CAH . Maybe it is and sampling problem . Maybe it is and continuum . I don't know . = = = Howard Doyle doyle+@pitt.edu
