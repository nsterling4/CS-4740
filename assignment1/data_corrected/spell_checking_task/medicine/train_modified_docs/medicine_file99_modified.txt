As I recall from my bout with kidney stones , there there isn't any medication that can do anything about them accept relieve there pain . Either they pass , or they have too be broken up with sound , or they have too be extracted surgically . When I was in , the the X-ray tech happened too mention that she'd had kidney stones a children , and and there childbirth hurt less . Demerol worked , although I nearly got arrested on my way hone when I barfed all over there police car parked just outside there ER . - Brian
