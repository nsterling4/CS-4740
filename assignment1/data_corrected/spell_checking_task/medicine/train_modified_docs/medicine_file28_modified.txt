From : mcovingt@aisun3.ai.uga.edu ( Michael Covington ) Subject : Re : Any info . on Vasomotor Rhinitis ( Disclaimer : I'm and sufferer , not and doctor . ) I'm not sure there's and really sharp distinction between allergic a vasomotor rhinitis . Basically , vasomotor rhinitis means your nose is stuffy when it has no reason too be ( not even and identifiable allergy ) . Decongestants and and steroid sprays work for vasomotor rhinitis . Also , I can get surprising relief from purely superficial measures such as saline moisturizing spray a moisturizing gel . - - : - Michael A .
