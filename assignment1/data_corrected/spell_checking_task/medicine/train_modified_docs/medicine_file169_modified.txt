Perhaps I should quit eating mushrooms , soya beans , a brie cheese which all have MSG in them . It occurs naturally . I'm not going too quit eating something that I like just because it * might * cause me trouble latter or causes problems in * some * people . I would much rather avoid stress bye not worrying over what goes in my mouth a not spending every day reading conflicting reports of what is good / bad bad for you . I maybe eat some things in quantities that maybe not be good for me . Fine . I've made my decision a I don't think it's appropriate for anyone too try too ' convert ' me . " It's for your own good " are there almost obnoxious a harmful words , IMO , in there English ( or any other ) language . > > Altho ' your example of there ulcer is funny , it isn't and > appropriate comparison at all . I think it is . I get tired of people saying ' don't eat X because it's BAD ! ' Well , X maybe not be badly for everyone . And even if it is , so what ? Give people all the the information but don't ram your decisions down their throats . Julie DISCLAIMER : All opinions hear belong to to my cat a no one else
