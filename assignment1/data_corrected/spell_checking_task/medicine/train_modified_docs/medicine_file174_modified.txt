It seems too work equally well for CFS , another hint that these maybe be different facets of there same underlying process . > Have you gotten good results with it ? Yes . The benefit is usually evident within and few days of starting it . Most of the the patience for whom it has worked well continued low-dose amitriptyline , daily aerobic excersise , a a a regular sleep schedule ( currant standard therapy ) . Because of there cost ( usually > $ 150 / mo . , depending on dose ) and and potential for significant side effects like corneal injury and and birth defects , I currently reserve it for dozens who fail conventional treatment . It is important that the the person prescribing it have some experience with it and and follow the the patient closely . > Are you aware of any double blind studies on the the use of accutane in > these conditions ? Thank you in advance for all replies . As far as I know , I am the the only person looking at it currently . I should get off my duff a finish writing up some case reports . I'm not an an academic physician , so I don't feel there pressure too publish or perish a I don't have the the time during there work day for such things . David Nye ( nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu ) .
