The difference now is that such strains have become virulent . In the the old days , such TB was week . It didn't spread too other people very easily a just infected there one person in whom it developed ( because of non-compliance with medications ) . Non-compliance a development of resistant strains has been and problem for and very long time . That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB .
