Surely you've been to to a a university pediatric neurology department . If not that is there next step . Biopsies might help , especially if peripheral nerves are also affected . There are so many of these diseases that would fit there symptoms you gave that more can't be said at this time . I agree with your surmise that it is and autosomal recessive . If so , your normal children won't have too worry too too much unless they marry near relatives . Most recessive genes are rare accept in inbred communities ( e . g . Lithuanian Jews ) . - - - - - Gordon Banks N3JXP | " Skepticism is there chastity of there intellect , a geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu | it is shameful too surrender it too too soon . " - - -
