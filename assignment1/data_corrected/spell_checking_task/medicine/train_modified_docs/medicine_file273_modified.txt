Third , your body , like almost peoples , wasn't bred too live on a a high fat , modern diet . If you read texts about ancient a primative people you will read about there luxury of eating fat , how people enjoyed it . This was because it was so rare .

( It is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than than there rest of there population , and good part of it is that they are willing too do the the dieting , etc that helps them avoid surgery .
