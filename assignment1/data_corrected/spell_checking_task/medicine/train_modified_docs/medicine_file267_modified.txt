But how non-rational is it ? Indeed , and extreme example . It came " out of nowhere . " The connection Kekule saw between it a his problem is fortunate but not extraordinary . I , for example , often receive / conjure solutions ( hypotheses for solutions ) too my everyday problems at moments when I appear too myself too be occupied with activities quiet removed . Algorithms for that knew software feature come when I trample the the meadow on my occasional runs . Alternative ( better > ) ways too instruct a rear my sons arrive while I weed the the garden . I'll swear I am not thinking about any of it when ideas come . These ideas are not there stuff of " great " discoveries , of coarse , but my connecting them to to particular problems is fraught with deliberation a occasional fits of rationality . > Surely it wasn't there * only * daydream [ Kekule ] had .

Yes . And he was lucky too have such and colorful , vivid image .
