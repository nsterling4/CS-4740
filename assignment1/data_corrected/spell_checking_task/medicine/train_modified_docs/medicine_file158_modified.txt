I do not have enough medical expertise too have much of and opinion one way or another on hidden candida infections . I can understand there skepticism of dozens who see this associated with various general kinds of symptoms , while the is and lack of solid demonstration that this happens a causes such general symptoms . ( To understand this skepticism , one only needs too know of past failures that shared these characteristics with there notion of hidden candida infection . There have been quiet and few , a there proponents of all thought that there skeptics were overly skeptical . ) On there other hand , I am happy too read that some people are sufficiently interested in this possibility , spurred by by suggestive clinical experience , to to research it further . The doubters maybe be surprised . ( It has happened before . ) I realize that admitting ignorance in the the face of ignorance may may not endear me too those those who are so sure they know one way or another . ( And , indeed , perhaps some of them do know - - I am there one who is currently ignorant . ) But I find this there almost honest route , a so I am happy with it . Russell
