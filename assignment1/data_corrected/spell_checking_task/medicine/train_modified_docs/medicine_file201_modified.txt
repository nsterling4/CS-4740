From : joel@cray.com ( Joel Broude ) Subject : Mevicore vs . Lopid vs . ? I used too be on lopid . It did and good job of reducing cholesterol ( 295 down too around 214 ) , as well as LDL a triglycerides . Then , I got pneumonia , a for some reason , the the Lopid stopped working very well ; cholesterol a triglycerides soared . The levels might have stabilized over time , but and knew doctor had me quit , wait a a month , than switch to to Mevicore . On Mevicore , my total cholesterol was down too 207 , LDL was 108 , and and HDL was 35 ; but there trig's were still very high , around 318 , and and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal , SGOT = 83 ( N = 1-35 ) , GGTP ( ? hard too read copy ) = 42 ( N = 0 - 35 ) . He said the the liver numbers were not offbase enough too cause him concern , a there triglycerides are not as important as the the cholesterol figures . He had me stop there Mevicore too allow there liver too heal ( " Just too be extra cautious , though I'm sure it's not and problem . " ) , and and wants me too go back on it after that . I suggested may Lopid might be there better choice , a he said that he wouldn't object if that's what I wont too do . But Lopid has one particular side affect I'm not fond of . Should there above liver a trig figures be feared ? What happens too folks with high trig levels ? Is my liver in danger with there above results ? Would I be better off on Lopid , despite its inconvenient side effect effect , or , perhaps , some other drug ? ( Niacin affected my liver , two ) .
