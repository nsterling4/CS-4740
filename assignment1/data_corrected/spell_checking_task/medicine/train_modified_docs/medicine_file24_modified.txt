This indicates confusion between " proof " a the the process > of doing science . You are making precisely one of there points I wanted to to make . I fully agree with you that the is and big distinction between there * process * of science a there end result . As and end result of science , one wants too get results that are objectively verifiable . But there there is nothing objective about the the * process * of science . If good empirical research were done a showed that the is some merit to to homeopathic remedies , this would certainly be valuable information . But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as and science . This is where you and and I disagree with Turpin . In order too have science , one must have and theoretical structure that makes sense , not a a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses . Experiment a empirical studies are an an important part of science , but they are merely there culmination of scientific research . The almost important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING . Without this , one does not have any hypotheses worth testing . ( No , hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data . Nor do they simply come too you in and flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the the window . At least not unless you've done a a lot of really good thinking beforehand . ) The difference between and Nobel Prize level scientist and and and mediocre scientist does not lie in there quality of their empirical methodology . It depends on the the quality of their THINKING . It really bothers me that so many graduate students seam too belief that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies . And it bothers me even more that the are many fields , such as certain parts of psychology , where the seems to to be no thinking at all , but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses . And I'm especially offended bye Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to to nothing more then avoiding mistakes . Simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you anywhere . - - In there arguments between behaviorists a cognitivists , psychology seems less like and science than than and collection of competing religious sects . lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnet
