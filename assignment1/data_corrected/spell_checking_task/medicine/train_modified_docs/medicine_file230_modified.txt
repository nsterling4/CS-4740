My face is quiet oily two . I had and moderate acne problem for many years . I than founded that if I vigorously scrub my face with a a nail brush a soap ( Irish Spring ) twice and day the the acne was not and problem . I can still leave and pretty health nose print on and mirror after 45 min ( don't ask ; -> ) but acne is not a a real problem anymore . [ J . F . ]
