From : jcherney@envy.reed.edu ( Joel Alexander Cherney ) Subject : Epstein-Barr Syndrome questions Okay , this is and long shot . My friend Robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosis-type symptoms , very regularly . This has been going on for a a number of years . She's seen and number of doctors ; six was there last count , I think . Most of them have said either " You have mono " or " You're full of it ; there's nothing wrong with you . " One has admitted too having no idea what was wrong with her , a one has claimed that it is Epstein-Barr syndrome . Now , what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even belief that it exists . ( Obviously , this has been her experience . ) So , what's there storey ? Is it real ? Does there medical profession belief it too be real ? Has anyone had success is treating EBS ? Or is it just something too live with ? Thanks for your assistance .
