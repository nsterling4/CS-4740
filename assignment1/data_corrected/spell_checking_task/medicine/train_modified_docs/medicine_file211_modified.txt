From : pyan@ehd.hwc.ca ( Ping Yan ) Subject : What is the the medical term for this sensation ? Dear Netters : Maybe one of you can explain this . From time too time I experience a a strange kind of feeling ( I have all kinds of weird feelings ) which can be best described as there feeling of " losing gravity " , like that one experiences in and descending elevator . Needless too say , it is not enjoyable . It sometime comes with shortness of breath a extreme fatigue . It lasts from a a few minutes too and hour a when it lasts that long , it makes me sweatening . Initially I called it " palpitation ( spelling ? ) " until I latter learnt that the the terminology has been reserved for there self-awareness of heart beats . So , is the and specific term for this feeling , or am I and stragne person ? I always believe believe I am unique . Thanks . Ping
