Happy ? Several years ago I tried too commit a a patient who was growing Salmonella out of his stool , blood , a and open ulcer for treatment . The idea was that there guy was and walking public health risk , a that forcing him too receive IV antibiotics for and few days was in there public interest . I will make and long storey short bye saying that there judge laughed at my idea , yelled at me for wasting his time , a let there guy go . I founded out that tuberculosis appears too be the the only MEDICAL ( as oppsed too psychiatric ) condition that one can be committed for , a this is because very specific laws were enacted many years ago regarding tb . I am certain these vary from state to to state . Any legal experts out the too help us on this ? - km
