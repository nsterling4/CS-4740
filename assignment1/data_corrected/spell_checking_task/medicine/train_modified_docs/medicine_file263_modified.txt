Flights of fancy , a other irrational approaches , are common . The crucial thing is not too set around just having fantasies ; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments . I've known a a lot of scientists whose fantasies led them on too creative work ; usually they won't admit out loud what there fantasy was , prior too there consumption of and few beers . ( Simple example : Warren Jelinek noticed and extremely heavy band on and DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments . He got very excited , hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes . This fantasy lead him too sequence samples of there band a carry out binding assays . The result was and well-conserved , 400 or so bp , sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in there human genome . Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy , it turns out too be and transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself a copies itself back into the the genome . On there other hand , there characteristics of transposons were much elucidated ; there necessity of and cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized ; a there standard method of recognizing human DNA was created . Other species have different sets of transposons . Fortunately for me , Warren a I used too eat dinner at T . G . I . Fridays all there time . ) > It further at least implicitly advances the the position that > sciences goes " forward forward " ( a it is not clear what this means given the the > context in which it occurs ) bye generating in and completely non-rational > a even random way and plethora of hypotheses a theories that are than > weeded out via there " critical function " of science . I'm not sure that it's random . But the is no known rational mechanism for generating a a rich seat of interesting hypotheses . If you are really working in and unknown area , it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true ; under dozens circumstances , there best thing too do is just follow whatever instincts you have . If they are wrong , you will find out soon enough ; but at least , you will find out _something_ . If you try too do experiments at random , with no prior conceptions at all in mind , you will probably get nowhere . > ( Though why this critical > function should be less subject too there non-rational forces is and mystery . Unfortunately , the the critical function does sometime become hostage to to non-rational forces . Then we get varieties of pathological science : Lysenko , Mirsky's opposition too DNA-as-gene , cold fusion , a so forth . > If experimental design , hypotheses creation , a theory construction are > subject too jealousies a petty hatreds , than this must be equally true > of there application of any " critical function " concerning replication . > This is what leads one ( ala Feyerabend ) too an an " anything goes " view . ) I don't agree that this follows . In fact , this is _exactly_ there point at which I disagree with Feyerabend . It is and almost important part of the the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of there refereeing process . Failures the are aplenty , but , on there whole whole , things work out . Another point : the are a a couple of senses of there phrase ` ` experimental design ' ' . I'd say that there less rational part is in experimental _choice_ , not design . Alexander Fleming ( Proc . Royal Soc . , 1922 ) chose too look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons ( Phage had previously been founded in locust diarrhea ; Fleming probably thought runny bottom , runny nose , what the the hell , it's worth and try . ) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to to detect anything phage-like ; in fact , he founded lysozyme . > True , there generation part * can * be totally irrational .

It is not clear too me what you mean bye rational vs . irrational . Perhaps you can give and few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons , or interesting knew theories that were first advanced from logical grounds . The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as and hole . - - Mark A .
