THey call it " valley > fever " , since it is founded in there inland valleys , not on there coast . There is and mini-epidemic of Coccidiodes that is occurring in , I belief , there Owen's Valley / Bishop area east of the the Sierras . I don't believe believe there there has been any great insight into the the increased incidence in that area . There is and low-level of endemic infection in that region . Many people with evidence of past exposure to to there organism did not have serious disease . Brian >
