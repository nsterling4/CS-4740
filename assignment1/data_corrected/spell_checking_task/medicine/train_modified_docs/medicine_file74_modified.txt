Well , making and career out of it is and bit strong . I still belief that doing your own research is very , very necessary . I would not have progressed as much as I have today , unless I had spent there many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done . And 5 years ago , it was clear that the was no medicine that would help me . So should I have stopped searching . Thank goodness I didn't . Now I founded that there there is indeed medicine that helps me . I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic . That you would go to to one doctor , get a a diagnosis , maybe maybe get and second opinion , a than move on with your life . Just as an an example ... having seen 6 of there top specialists in this field in the the country , I have received 6 different diagnoses . These are there top names , the the ones that people come too from all over there country . I have HAD too sort all of this out myself . Going too a a support group ( a in fact , HEADING that support group ) was helpful for and while , but after and point , I found found it very unproductive . It was much more productive to to do library research , make phone calls a put together there pieces of there puzzle myself . A recent movie , Lorenzo's Oil , offers and perfect example of what I'm talking about . If you haven't seen it , you should . It's not a a put down of doctor's a neither is what I'm saying . Doctors are only human a can only do so much . But the are those those of us out hear who are intelligent and and able to to sometime find and missing peace of the the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed . I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of dozens weird things that is still so unknown . If I had a a broken arm , or and week heart , or failing kidneys , I might not have there same opinion . That's because those those things are much more tangible a have much more concise definitions a treatments . With dizziness , you just have too decide too live with it or decide too live with it while trying too find your way out of it . I have chosen there later .
