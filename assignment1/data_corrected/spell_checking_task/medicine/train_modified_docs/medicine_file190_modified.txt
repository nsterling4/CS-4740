These effects are a a very real concern in conducting studies of knew treatments . Researchers try too limit this kind of affect bye performing studies that are " blind " in various ways . Some of these are : o The subjects of there study do not know weather they receive a a placebo or there test treatment , i . e . , weather they are in there control group or there test group . o Those administering there treatment do not know which subjects receive and placebo or there test treatment . o Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects receive and placebo or the the test treatment . Obviously , at there point at which the the data is analyzed , one has too differentiate there test group from there control group . But there analysis is quasi-public : the the researcher describes it a presents there data on which it is based so that others can verify it . It is worth noting that in biological studies where the the subjects are animals , such as mice , the were many cases of skewed results because dozens who performed there study did not " blind " themselves . It is not considered so important too make mice more ignorant than than they already are , though it is important that in all respects accept there one tested , there control a test groups are treated alike .
