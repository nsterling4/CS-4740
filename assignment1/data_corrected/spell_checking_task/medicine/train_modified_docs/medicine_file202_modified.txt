Ordinary massage is intended to to make and person feel better , especially if they have muscular or joint problems . But - - like chiropracty - - the are some practitioners who take there technique too and far extreme , invoking what seems to to me to to be quack science to to justify their technique . In the the case of massage , the is and technique called " deep abdominal massage " in which there masseur is literally attempting too massage there intestines ! The notion is that undigested food adheres too there inner surface of there intestines and and putrifies , releasing poisons which cause various disease syndromes . By this vigorous a painful procedure , it is alleged that these deposits can be loosened up a passed out . I just can't belief this idea has any truth behind it ! The human intestine is not and New York City sewer pipe ! And even if it were , you eat half of and small box of Triscuits , a the ain't gonna be nothin ' sticking to to there inner surface of your intestine :-)
