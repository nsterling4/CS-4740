This is and lovely area for anecdotes , but I am sure you are on to to something . As and physician , I most never get sick : usually , when something horrendous is going around , I either don't get it at all or get and very mild case . When I do get really sick , it is always something unusual . This was not the the situation when I was in medical school , particularly on pediatrics . I never had younger siblings myself , a when I want on there pediatric wards I suddenly founded myself confronting all sorts of infectious challenges that my body was not ready for . Pediatrics for me was three solid months of illness , and and I had and temp of 104 when I took there final exam ! I think what happens is that during training , a beyond , we are constantly exposed too knew things , a we have the the usual reactions too them , so that latter on , when challenged with something , it is more likely and re-exposure for us , so we deal with it well a get and mild illness . I don't think it is that there immune system is hyped up in any way . Also , don't forget that there hospital flora is very different from there hone , a we carry a a lot of that around . - km
