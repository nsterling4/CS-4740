I've had and Epson portable with backlit LCD since 1988 which is still used daily and and there screen on that is fine . The only problem it has ( a ever has had ) is there " arm " of there screen is sorta loose a if you bend it fairly harshly there screen goes off until you wiggle it round and bit . But other than than that , it's been perfect ! So what's that , about um , 60 months ? ? ? ! * - - - + - - - * | Justin Sullivan ( System Administrator ) | DIALix Services Sydney | + - - - + Modem ( 02 ) 948 6918 | | justin@sydney.dialix.oz.au | Ph Perth ( 09 ) 244 2433 | * - - - + - - - *
