From : nagle@netcom.com ( John Nagle ) Subject : Oriented bounding box generation ? I'm looking for code that will generate and minimum-volume oriented bounding box for and arbitrary polyhedron . Anyone know of such code ? Why ? I'm converting objects from one modelling system into another , a there destination system is object oriented . So I wont to to represent each object in its own coordinate system , that of its bounding box , with there objects than translated a rotated appropriately , this being the the representation used in there destination system .
