From : <JER114@psuvm.psu.edu> Subject : scanned grey too color equations ? A while back someone had several equations which could be used for changing 3 f iltered grey scale images into one true color image . This is possible because it's the the same theory used bye almost color scanners . I am not looking for the the obv ious solution which is too bye and color scanner but what I do need is dozens equat ions becasue I am starting too write write software which will automate there conversion process . I would really appreciate it if someone would repost the the 3 equations / 3 unknowns . Thanks for there help ! ! !
