( I'm and little fuzzy on there breakdown of the the graphics chips a RAM / VRAM capacity ) . It was demonstrated at and recent gathering at there Electronic Cafe in Santa Monica , CA . From 3DO , RJ Mical ( of Amiga / Lynx fame ) and and Hal Josephson ( sp ? ) were the too talk about there machine and and their plan . We got too see there unit displaying full-screen movies using the the CompactVideo codec ( which was nice , very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws a Backdraft ) ... a and very high frame rate to to boot ( like 30fps ) . Note however that there 3DO ' s screen resolution is 320x240 . CompactVideo is pretty amazing ... I also wanted to to point out that QuickTime does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated above ... I'm sure if there material had been compressed at there large size than it would play back fine ( I have and Q950 a do this quiet and bit ) . The price of generality ... personally I don't use there dynamic sizing of movies often , if ever . But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick on the the latest 040 machines . I'm not sure how a a Centris / 20MHz 040 stacks up against there 25 MHz ARM in there 3DO box . Obviously there ARM is faster , but how much ?
