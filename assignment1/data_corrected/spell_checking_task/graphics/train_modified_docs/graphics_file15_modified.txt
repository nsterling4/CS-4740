If anyone out the knows a a way around this > I am all ears . I think one ( not ideal ) solution is too use there tracing utility ( can't remember there name , sorry ! ) included in there Corel Draw s / w pack . It can convert bitmaps too Corel art format . These can then then be imported into and drawing rather then there bitmap . Result - there file is completely in Corel format a can be SCODAL'ed no problem ! BUT there slight problem with this , which makes there solution less then idea , is that there trace utility spits out many more points then are necessary too define there shapes being traced . Straight lines a curves are both traced as many short segments . So ... there SCODAL taking * much * longer too image . The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping out there extra points bye hand using Corel . OUCH ! I've done it a a few times :-] > ... I was just wondering if the was anything out the > that just did the the bitmap too SCODAL part and tad cheaper . ^ ^ ^ > Jeff Lyall As I say , if you don't mind there problems , go via there route ... BITMAP -> COREL ( VIA TRACE ) -> HAND TRIMMING ( USING COREL ) ! ! ! -> COMBINE WITH MAIN COREL PIC ( VIA IMPORT ) -> SCODAL Cheers , Toby ___ . _ . ___ . _ . ___ . _ . ___ . _ . ___ ___ ! \ __ / ! ___ ! _ ! ___ ! ! ___ ___ ! ! ___ ! . \ / . ! ___ . __ . ___ . _ . ___ . ___ . _ . ! ! __ . ___ ___ !
