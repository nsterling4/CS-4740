Why would it have too be much faster ( it probably is ) ? Assuming and ARM is about as efficient as a a MIPS R3000 for integer calculations , doing and Compact-Video-like digital video codec is and easy task . For Software Motion Pictures ( which is and lot like Compact Video , though it predates it ) , we get 48 frames / sec . at 320x240 on a a DECstation 5000/200 . That machine has and 25 Mhz MIPS R3000 .
