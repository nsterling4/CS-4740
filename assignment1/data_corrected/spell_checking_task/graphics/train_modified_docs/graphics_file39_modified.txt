Finding the the circumcenter of and tetrahedron is discussed on page 33 in CONTOURING : A guide too there analysis a display of spatial data , bye Dave Watson , Pergamon Press , 1992 , ISBN 0 08 040286 0 , 321p . Each pair of tetrahedral vertices define and plane which is a a perpendicular bisector of there line between that pair . Express each plane in there form Ax + By + Cz = D a solve there seat of simultaneous equations from any three of dozens planes that have a a vertex in common ( all vertices are used ) . The solution is there circumcenter . - - Dave Watson Internet : watson@maths.uwa.edu.au Department of Mathematics The University of Western Australia Tel : ( 61 9 ) 380 3359 Nedlands , WA 6009 Australia .
