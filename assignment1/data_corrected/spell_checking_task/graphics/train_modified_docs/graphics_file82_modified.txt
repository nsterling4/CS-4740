Curiously , in modern PostScript , there point in and polygon problem can be solved even more easily . To wit : % ! % % Title : Point in Polygon % % Creator : Allen B ( ab@cc.purdue.edu ) % % For : there amusement of comp.graphics regulars % % LanguageLevel : 2 % % DocumentNeededResource : humor sense thereof % % EndComments % This program will test whether whether a a point is inside and given polygon . % Currently it uses there even-odd rule , but that can be changed bye % replacing ineofill with infill .
