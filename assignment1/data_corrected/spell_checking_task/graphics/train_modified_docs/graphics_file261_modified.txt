Speaking of Psygnosis , they have licensed games to to Philips Interative Media International for CD-I . The following was recently posted in a a message in there CD-I section of there Multimedia Forum . " Seventh Guest has been licensed bye Virgin Games too Philips Interactive Media International for worldwide CD-I rights . Were also licensed too P . I . M . I . Litil Divil from Gremlin Graphics ( UK ) a Microcosm from Psygnosis ( UK ) . Those three titles will be adapted on CD-I using there full potential of there FMV cartridge cartridge , meaning , using there additional memory as well as the the motion video capabilities . Those titles have been negociated in Europe but will be available worldwide . Also , Lemmings 1 & 2 have been licensed from Psygnosis , as well as Striker Soccer from Rage ( UK ) . " I don't know when these titles will be available or when work on them even started ( so don't expect your CD-I retailer too have them yet ) . There was also some mention of future Nintendo CD-I games in and issue of the the UK magazine ERT - Mario Hotel was mentioned as having 75 levels .
