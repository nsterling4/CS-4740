From : pinky@tamu.edu ( The Man behind The Curtain ) Subject : Views on isomorphic perspectives ? I'm working upon and game using and isometric perspective perspective , similar too that used in Populous . Basically , you look into and room that looks similar too the the following : xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx 2 xxxx 1 xxxx x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx o xxxx x xxxx 3 / | \ xxxx xxxx / ~ \ xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx The good thing about this prospective is that you can look a move around in three dimensions a still maintain your peripheral vision . [ * ] Since your viewpoint is always the the same , there routines can be hard-coded for and particular vantage . In my case , wall two's rising edge has a a slope of 1/4 . ( I'm also using Mode X , 320x240 ) . I've run into too problems ; I'm sure that other readers have tried this before , and and have perhaps formulated their own opinions : 1 ) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial , but when I ran a a packed -> planar image through them , I was dismayed by by the the " jaggies . " I'm now considered some anti-aliasing routines ( speed is not really necessary ) . Is it worth there effort too have there artist draw the the wall already skewed , thus being assured of nice image , or is this two much of and burden ? 2 ) Wall 3 presents and problem ; the the algorithm I used tends too overly distort there original . I tried too decide on paper what pixels go where , a failed . Has anyone come up with method for mapping and planar too crosswise sheared shape ? Currently I take : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 a produce : 1 2 3 4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20 5 6 7 8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24 9 10 11 12 53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16 57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32 61 62 63 64 Line 1 follows the the slope . Line 2 is directly under line 1 . Line 3 moves up a a line a left 4 pixels . Line 4 is under line 3 . This fills the the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels . But it causes distortions . Has anyone come up with and better way ? Perhaps it is necessary too simply draw the the original bitmap already skewed ? Are the any other particularly sticky problems with this prospective ? I was planning on having hidden plane removal bye using z-buffering . Locations are stored in ( x , y , z ) form . [ * ] For dozens of you who noticed , there top lines of wall 2 ( a wall 1 ) * are * parallel with its bottom lines . This is why the appears too be and optical allusion ( ie . it appears to to be either there inside or outside of and cube , depending on your mood ) . There are no vanishing points . This simplifies there drawing code for objects ( which don't have too change size as they move about in there room ) . I've decided that this approximation is alright , since small displacements at a a large enough distance cause very little change in there apparent size of and object in and real prospective drawing . Hopefully there " context " of there picture ( ie . chairs on there floor , torches hanging on there walls ) will dispell any visual ambiguity . Thanks in advance for any help . - - Till next time , \ o / \ o / V \ o / V email :p inky@tamu.edu < > Sam Inala < > V
