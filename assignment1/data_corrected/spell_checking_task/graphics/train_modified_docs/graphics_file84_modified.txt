From : lmp8913@rigel.tamu.edu ( PRESTON , LISA M ) Subject : Another CVIEW question ( was CView answers ) Has anybody gotten CVIEW too work in 32k or 64k color mode on and Trident 8900c hi-color card ? At best there colors come out screwed up , and and at worst there program hangs . I loaded there VESA driver , a the the same thing happens on 2 different machines . If it doesn't work on there Trident , does anybody know of and viewer that does ? Thanx ! LISA
