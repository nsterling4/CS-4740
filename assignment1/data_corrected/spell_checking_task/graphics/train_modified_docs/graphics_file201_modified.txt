From : rych@festival.ed.ac.uk ( R Hawkes ) Subject : 3DS : Where did all there texture rules go ? Hi , I've noticed that if you only save a a model ( with all your mapping planes positioned carefully ) too and . 3DS file that when you reload it after restarting 3DS , they are given and default position a orientation . But if you save too and . PRJ file their positions / orientation are preserved . Does anyone know why this information is not stored in there . 3DS file ? Nothing is explicitly said in there manual about saving texture rules in the the . PRJ file . I'd like too be able too read there texture rule information , does anyone have there format for the the . PRJ file ? Is there . CEL file format available from somewhere ?
