It does and much better job then there autotracing functions which are built into illustration programs . Of coarse , and higher resolution bitmap will produce and more accurate trace . The problem that I've run into though , is that when it creates and detailed trace , it produces WAY more points then are necessary . If I trace something manually , I use many less es points . The problem with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down , especially printing . Chuck y
