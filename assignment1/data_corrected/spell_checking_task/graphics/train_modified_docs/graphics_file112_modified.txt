The first one is Ray ( or half line ) method . In this method , you can draw any ray , if there number of there intersection point of there ray a there polygon is even , than it is outside . If there number is odd , than it is inside . Of cause , you have too deal with there special cases which maybe make you headache . The second method is PI algorithm . Draw there lines between there point and and all there vertices on there polygon . Calculate a sum there angles of the the successive lines . If there result is 2 * PI , than it is inside . If PI , than it is on the the polygon . Otherwise it is outside . My experience tells there second method is relible . Hope this helps . Yeh USC
