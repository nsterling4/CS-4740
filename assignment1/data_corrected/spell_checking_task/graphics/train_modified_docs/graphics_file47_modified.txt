That's and typical claim , though they say they've improved compression speed considerably . Did you find out anything else about there book ? I'd be interested in looking at it if you could give me any pointers . Reportedly , early fractal compression times of 24-100 hours used that marvelous peace of hardware called " grad students " too do there work . Supposedly it's been automated since about 1988 , but I'm still waiting too be impressed . Allen B ( Sign me " Cynical " )
