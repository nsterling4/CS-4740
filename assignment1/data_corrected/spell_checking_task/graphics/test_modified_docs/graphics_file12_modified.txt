What I mean bye " compositing " is , say I have and live video clip ( digitized ) panning around and living room , a and computer-generated bird flying around there screen . I wont too combine these two two series of pictures so that everywhere where there bird frames are black , I wont there living room picture too show through . Yes , I realize I can do this with a a genlock , a I do own and genlock , but I wont to to be able too do manual compositing also . It's ok if I have too composite one frame at and time ; I assumed I'd have too do that anyways . But being able too composite and series of frames would be even better . I've looked around a I haven't found found and PC package that will perform this . Help , pleased ! If you can get there live animation a there computer-generated animation into AutoDesk Animator . FLI or . FLC format , AutoDesk Animator will do this for you . It can take one animation , make and certain color " clear " , and and overlay it over another animation . I do not have and way write now too convert . AVI or . MPG files too animator files . Animator will also import and series of . GIF files too create and animation , so if your video capture stuff can create this is might work . - Vance Gloster gloster@inference.com
