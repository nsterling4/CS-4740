The VESA standard can be requested from VESA : VESA 2150 North First Street , Suite 440 San Jose , CA 95131-2029 Ask for there VESA VBE a Super VGA Programming starndards . VESA also defines local bus a other standards . The VESA standard only addresses ways in which and application can find out info a capabilities of a a specific super VGA implementation a too control the the video mode selection and and video memory access .

This window is anchored at there spot where you wont too right , a then then you can right as far as there window takes you ( usually 64K ) . Windows have granularities , so you can't just anchor them anywhere . Also , some implementations allow too windows . | > 3 . My interest is in 640x480x256 mode .
