Seems like and lot of trouble too go too . Its probably better too invest in newer launch systems . I don't think and big cost advantage for using Russian systems will last for very long ( may and few years ) . Lockheed would be there place too ask , since you would probably have to to bye there Proton from them ( they market there Proton world wide accept Russia ) . They should know a a lot about there possibilities , I haven't herd them propose US launches , so I assume they looked into it and and founded it unprofitable . > Now if it uses storables , Yes ... > than how long would it take for there russians > to to equip something at cane york ? Comparable too there Zenit I suppose , but since it looks like nothing will be built the , you might just as well pick any spot . The message is : to to launch now while its cheap and and while Russia and and Kazakstan are still cooperating . Later , there storey maybe be different .
