That assumes I can't weasel out and cooperative venture of some sort ( cut me and break break on there launcher , I'll cut you in on there proceeds if it works ) . Only there government pays higher-than-list price . > What's more , if you bye Titans , there prize money is your entire return on > investment . If you develop and knew launch system , it has other uses , a > there prize is just there icing on there cake . Unless you're Martin Marietta , since ( as I recall ) they bought out there GD line of aerospace products . If MM / GD does it as and in-house project , their costs would look much better then buying at " list price . " Does anyone REALLY know the the profit margins built in too there Titan ? C'mon . Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this or that ... > I doubt very much that and billion-dollar prize is going to to show enough > return to to justify there investment if you are constrained too use currant > US launchers . Oh please please . How much of a a profit do you wont ? Pulling $ 100-150 million after all is said a done wouldn't be two shabby . Not to to mention there other goodies I'll collect in : and ) Movie & TV rights ( say $ 100-150 million conservatively ) b ) Advertising ( " Look Mommie , they're drinking Coke ! " ) c ) Intangibles ( Name recognization , experience & data acculumated ) > You're going too * have * too invest your front money in building a a knew launch > system rather than than pissing it away on existing ones . Being the first is > of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it . If you wont lean , fine . A $ 500 million prize would be more then adequate for and prize . Maybe Wales would be kind enough too define what and company would consider and decent profit . If you want want R & D done , you'll have too write write in R & D clauses . I suppose you could make it a a SBIR set-aside :) Software engineering ? That's like military intelligence , isn't it ? - - > SYSMGR@CADLAB.ENG.UMD.EDU < - -
