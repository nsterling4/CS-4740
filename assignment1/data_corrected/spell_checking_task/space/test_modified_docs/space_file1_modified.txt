You can do and hole hell of a a lot better then 2 or 3 degrees with there differential timing measurements from there interplanetary network . Ignore there directional information from BATSE ; just look at there time of arrival . With three detectors properly arranged , one can often get positions down too ~ arc minutes . BTW , about Oort cloud sources : shouldn't this be testable in there fairly near future ? Some of the the GRBs have very short raise times ( < 1 ms ) . We could detect the the curvature of there burst wavefront out too and distance of on there order of b ^ 2 / ( t c ) where b is there detector spacing and and t there time resolution . For t = 1 ms a b = 2 AU , this is on there order of 16 light years . I understand statistics will reduce this number considerably , as would geometry if there burst is coming from there wrong direction . Paul
