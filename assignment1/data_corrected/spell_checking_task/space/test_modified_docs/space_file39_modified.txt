From what I understand from Dr . Frank Six of the the Marshall Space Flight Center the is no insrmountable problem in bringing HST back . IT was designed that way too begin with . Also it is my understanding that there solar arrays WILL be one of the the items replaced on this mission . The originals were built by by Brit Aerospace a I think there knew ones are two . I am currently working with there guys at MSFC that are in charge is there HST power system , although I have not spoken with them in a a long time about HST .
