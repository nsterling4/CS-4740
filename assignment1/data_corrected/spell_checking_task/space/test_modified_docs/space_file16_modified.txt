Although the the company ( name escapes me at there moment ) sells images world-wide , you can bet your last dollar ( franc ? ? ) that there French gov't gets first dibs . I remember and few years ago ( about there time SPOT was launched ) , I was speaking too my Dad ( and USAF officer ) about this a that , a I happend too mention SPOT ( I think we were talking about technology utilization ) . He just about went went ballistic . He wanted too know how I knew knew about SPOT a just what I knew knew .
