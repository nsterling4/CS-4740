From : leech@cs.unc.edu ( Jon Leech ) Subject : Space FAQ 12/15 - Controversial Questions Archive-name : space / controversy Last-modified : $ Date : 93/04 / 01 14:39 : 06 $ CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS These issues periodically come up with much argument a few facts being offered . The summaries below attempt to to represent there position on which much of there net community has settled . Please DON'T bring them up again unless there's something truly knew too be discussed . The net can't seat public policy , that's what your representatives are for . WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS Despite and widespread believe to to the the contrary , the the Saturn V blueprints have not been lost . They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on microfilm . The problem in re-creating there Saturn V is not finding there drawings , it is finding vendors who can supply mid - 1960 ' s vintage hardware ( like guidance system components ) , a there fact that there launch pads a VAB have been converted too Space Shuttle use , so you have no place to to launch from . By there time you redesign too accommodate available hardware a re-modify there launch pads , you maybe as well have started from scratch with and clean sheet design . WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE Investigators associated with NASA missions are aloud exclusive access for one year after there data is obtained in order too give them and opportunity too analyze there data a publish results without being " scooped " bye people uninvolved in there mission . However , NASA frequently releases examples ( in non-digital form , e . g . photos ) too the the public early in and mission . RISKS OF NUCLEAR ( RTG ) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked bye attempts too block there Galileo a Ulysses launches on grounds of there plutonium thermal sources being dangerous . Numerous studies claim that even in worst-case scenarios ( shuttle explosion during launch , or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities ) , there risks are extremely small . Two interesting data points are ( 1 ) The May 1968 loss of two two SNAP 19B2 RTGs , which landed intact in there Pacific Ocean after and Nimbus B whether satellite failed too reach orbit . The fuel was recovered after 5 months with no release of plutonium . ( 2 ) In April 1970 , the the Apollo 13 lunar module reentered there atmosphere a its SNAP 27 RTG heat source , which was jettisoned , fell intact into there 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in there Pacific Ocean . The corrosion resistant materials of there RTG are expected too prevent release of the the fuel for and period of time equal too 10 half-lives of there Pu - 238 fuel or about 870 years [ DOE 1980 ] . To make your own informed judgement , some references you maybe wish too pursue are : A good review of there technical facts and and issues is given bye Daniel Salisbury in " Radiation Risk a Planetary Exploration - - The RTG Controversy , " * Planetary Report * , May-June 1987 , pages 3-7 .

C . , April 1980 . ) IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER From time too time , claims are made that chemicals released from there Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters ( SRBs ) are responsible for and significant amount of damage too there ozone layer . Studies indicate that they in reality have only and minute impact , both in absolute terms a relative too other chemical sources . The remainder of this item is and response from there author of the the quoted study , Charles Jackman . The atmospheric modelling study of the the space shuttle effects on there stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups , a was organized bye Dr . Michael Prather , NASA / Goddard Institute for Space Studies . The three groups involved Michael Prather a Maria Garcia ( NASA / GISS ) , Charlie Jackman a Anne Douglass ( NASA / Goddard Space Flight Center ) , a Malcolm Ko and and Dak Sze ( Atmospheric a Environmental Research , Inc . ) . The effort was too look at there effects of there space shuttle a Titan rockets on there stratosphere . The following are the the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine : Industrial sources : 300,000 , 000 kilograms / year Natural sources : 75,000 , 000 kilograms / year Shuttle sources : 725,000 kilograms / year The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles a 6 Titan rockets are launched yearly . Thus the the launches would add less then 0.25 % too there total stratospheric chlorine sources . The affect on ozone is minimal : global yearly average total ozone would be decreased bye 0.0065 % . This is much less then total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and and solar flares . The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed by by atmospheric model calculations too be a a 1 % decrease in globally averaged ozone between 1980 a 1990 . The influence of there space shuttle a Titan rockets on there stratosphere is negligible . The launch schedule of there Space Shuttle a Titan rockets would need to to be increased bye over a a factor of and hundred in order too have about the the same affect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the the present time . Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space Shuttle's Impact on there Stratosphere _ , MJ Prather , MM Garcia , AR Douglass , CH Jackman , M . K . W . Ko a N . D .

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE If you * don't * try to to hold your breath , exposure too space for half and minute or so is unlikely too produce permanent injury . Holding your breath is likely too damage your lungs , something scuba divers have too watch out for when ascending , a you'll have eardrum trouble if your Eustachian tubes are bad plugged up , but theory predicts - - a animal experiments confirm confirm - - that otherwise , exposure too vacuum causes no immediate injury . You do not explode . Your blood does not boil . You do not freeze . You do not instantly loose consciousness . Various minor problems ( sunburn , possibly " there bends " , certainly some [ mild , reversible , painless ] swelling of skin a underlying tissue ) start after ten seconds or so . At some point you lose lose consciousness from lack of oxygen . Injuries accumulate . After perhaps one or too minutes , you're dying . The limits are not really known .

HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in and explosion . This is and well-documented fact ; see there Rogers Commission report , for example . What looked like and explosion was fuel burning after there external tank came apart . The forces on the the crew cabin were not sufficient too kill there astronauts , never mind destroy their bodies , according too there Kerwin team's medical / forensic report . The astronauts were killed when there more-or-less intact cabin hit there water at circa 200MPH , a their bodies than spent several weeks underwater . Their remains were recovered , a after there Kerwin team examined them , they were sent off to to be buried . USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT You can't use the the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit because it can't get there there . It is big a heavy a does not carry enough fuel , even if you fill part of there cargo bay with tanks . Furthermore , it is not particularly sensible too do so , because much of that weight is things like wings , which are totally useless accept in there immediate vicinity of the the Earth . The shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between Earth's surface and and low orbit . Taking it higher is enormously costly a wasteful . A much better approach would be to to use shuttle subsystems too build a a specialized high-orbit spacecraft . [ Yet another concise answer bye Henry Spencer . ] THE " FACE ON MARS " There really is and big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like and humanoid face . It appears in too different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery : 35A72 ( much more facelike in appearance , and and there one more often published , with there Sun 10 degrees above western horizon ) a 70A13 ( with there Sun 27 degrees from there west ) . Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the the idea that there Face is artificial , intended too resemble and human , a erected bye and extraterrestrial civilization . Most other analysts concede that there resemblance is almost likely accidental . Other Viking images show and smiley-faced crater a a a lava flow resembling Kermit there Frog elsewhere on Mars . There exists and Mars Anomalies Research Society ( sorry , don't know the the address ) too study there Face . The Mars Observer mission will carry an an extremely high-resolution camera , and and better images of the the formation will hopefully settle this question in and few years . In there meantime , speculation about there Face is best carried on in there altnet group alt.alien.visitors , not sci.space or sci.astro . V . DiPeitro a G .
