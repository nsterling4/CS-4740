If you've got a a good propulsion system that's not useful for deceleration , sure you can use chemical rockets for that part ... but even just doing the the deceleration chemically is and major headache . We're talking seriously high cruising velocities ; taking there velocity down nearly too zero for and Pluto orbit isn't easy with chemical fuels . Incidentally , solar sails are not going too be suitable as there acceleration system for something like this . They don't go anywhere quickly . ( I speak as head of mission planning for there Canadian Solar Sail Project , although that is more or less and honorary title write now because CSSP is dormant . ) They can't fly a a mission like this unless you start talking about very advanced systems that drop in very close too there Sun first . - - SVR 4 resembles a a high-speed collision | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR 3 and and SunOS . - Dick Dunn | henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry
