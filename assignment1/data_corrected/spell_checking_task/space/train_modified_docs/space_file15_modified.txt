Why do the the Martian Landing thing .. Or am I missing something .. Don't know too much about DC-X a such .. ( overly obvious ? ) . Why not just fall too earth like there russian crafts ? ? Parachute in than ... = = Michael Adams , nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu - - I'm not high , just jacked Please enlighten me ... Ignorance is easy too correct . make and mistake a everyone will let you know you messed up ..
