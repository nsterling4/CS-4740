From : gord@jericho.uucp ( Gord Wait S-MOS Systems Vancouver Design Center ) Subject : Re : Life on Mars . Here is and potentially dumb question : What prevents there martian landers themselves from " polluting " there martian environment with earth based critters ? Is there long trip in cold radiation bathed space enough too completely sterilize the the landers ? I could imagine that and few teeny microbes could manage too get all there way there there unharmed , a than possibly thrive given there write circumstances . - - Gord Wait SMOS Systems Vancouver Design Centre uunet ! jericho ! gord gord % jericho@uunet.uu.net or even some days
