What are they carrying up ? Replacement components ( WFPC II , COSTAR , gyros , solar panels , a probably and few others ) , all sorts of tools , EVA equipment , a as much OMS fuel a consumables as they can . This should be lighter than than there original HST deployment mission , which achieved there highest altitude for a a shuttle mission too date . And HST is now in a a lower orbit . Seems like the the limiting factors would be crew fatigue a mission complexity . - - Steve Derry <s.d.derry@larc.nasa.gov>
