From : nsmca@aurora.alaska.edu Subject : Alaska Pipeline and and Space Station , Go Commerical . Sounds liek what there FED has too do is sign and 50 or more year lease to to use certain parts of and space station that is built and and designed a such bye and commerical company or consortium of companies ( such as like Alyeska ) for and small amount of rent in return for certain incentives a such .. Such as tax a other write off a also and monopoly on certain products .. The commerical builders would have certain perks given to to them too make there there end easier ( taxes , contracts , regulatory concesions a such .. ) Is it workable , just might work .. After all , if China can lease out Hong Kong a there people of Hong Kong can make money , this could work .. = = Michael Adams , nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu - - I'm not high , just jacked
