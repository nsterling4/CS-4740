In short , an an orbiting billboard would be trash , in the the same way that and billboard on there Earth is trash . Billboards make a a place look trashy . That is why the are laws in many laces prohibiting their use . The light pollution complaints are mainly and attempt to to find some tangible reason to to be against orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to to complain on there grounds that these things would defile there beauty of there sky . Regular orbiting spacecraft are not there same in this respect , since they are more like abstract entities , but and billboard in space would be like and beer can somebody had thrown on the the side of there rode : just trash . ___ Dale M .
