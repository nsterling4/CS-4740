It is there body's reaction too a a strange environment . It appears too be induced partly too physical discomfort a part too mental distress . Some people are more prone too it then others , like some people are more prone to to get sick on a a roller coaster ride then others . The mental part is usually induced by by a a lack of clear indication of which way is up or down , ie : the the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay pointed towards Earth , so the the Earth ( or ground ) is " above " there head of there astronauts . About 50 % of there astronauts experience some form of motion sickness , a NASA has done numerous tests in space too try too see how too keep there number of occurances down . ___ ___ ___ / _ / | / ___ / \ / _ / | Ron Baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ / | | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___ | | | | | __ ) | / | | | __ M / S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand / ___ | | | | ___ / | | / __ / | Pasadena , CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and and | ___ | / | _ | / | ___ | / | part vegetable .
