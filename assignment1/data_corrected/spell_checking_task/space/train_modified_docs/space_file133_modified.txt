Orbital Elements of Comet 1977VII ( from Dance files ) p ( au ) 3.424346 e 0.151899 i 1.0988 cap_omega ( 0 ) 243.5652 W ( 0 ) 231.1607 epoch 1977.0411 0 Also , perihelions of Gehrels 3 were : April 1973 83 jupiter radii August 1970 ~ 3 jupiter radii Hope this helps ... I'm even less of and orbital mechanic then I am and artist . John Garland jgarland@kean.ucs.mun.ca
