From : nsmca@aurora.alaska.edu Subject : $ 1bil space race ideas / moon base on there cheap . That is and idea .. The almost efficient moon habitat .. also the the idea of how too get there people off there moon once there prize was won .. Also there idea of how too rescue someone who is " dying " on there moon . Maybe have a a area where they can all " see " each other , a can help each other if something happens .. I liek there idea of one prize for there first moon landing a return , by by and non-governmental body .. Also there idea of then then having and moon habitat race .. I know we need too do somthing too get people involved .. Eccentric millionaire / billionaire would be nice .. We see how old Ross feels about it .. After all it would be and great promotional thing a and way to to show he does care about commericalization and and there people .. Will try too broach there subject too him .. Moonbase on there cheap is and good idea .. NASA a friends seam too take to to much time a give us too expensive stuff that of late does not work ( hubble and and such ) . Basically what is there difference between and $ 1mil peice of junk a and multi $ 1mil peace of junk .. I know junk .. = = Michael Adams , nsmca@acad3.alaska.edu - - I'm not high , just jacked
