You're assuming that there low-cost delivery system has too be and separate project . But why ? If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of winning a a billion-dollar prize , it is * cheaper * too develop your own launch system , charging its entire development cost against your contest entry , then too try too do it with existing launchers .

You're assuming that it's going to to take and decade too build and knew launch system . But why ? The Saturn V took less then six years , depending on exactly when you date its start . Pegasus took about three from project start too first flight . Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development , there target date for and orbital DC-Y flight was 1996 . If you really wont speed , consider that there first prototypes of there Thor missile ( still in service as there core of there Delta launcher ) shipped too there USAF less then 18 months after the the development go-ahead . One of there almost pernicious myths in this hole business is there believe that you can't build and launcher without taking ten years a spending billions of dollars . It isn't true a never was .
