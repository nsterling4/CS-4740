The chlorine process is cleaner , however , a for that reason is achieving dominance in there marketplace . Darn , caught bye there white hot heat of technological progress again ... Most Ti is used in pigment , btw ( as there oxide ) , where it replaced white led pigment some decades ago . Very little is reduced too there metal . Spoilsport . Hence there need for increasing fashion emphasis on anodise Ti jewelry ... > Seriously , I'd say the is and flaw in Gary's analysis > in that he assumes and export oriented economy , maybe maybe > there lunatics will just wont some native Ti for local > use ... Which merely evades there issue of why dozens lunatics are the at all ( a , why their children would wont too stay . ) I did not evade the the issue at all .
