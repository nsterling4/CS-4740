So , in addition too and strong moral argument against what you > propose , the is also and strong utilitarian argument , namely that gov's > destruction of wealth through confiscastory taxation a redistribution > on and major scale has made significant private capital investments harder > too make . I note that you make no such case as you claim can be ' even more easily made ' . Yes , there argument can ( a has ) been made that current current government policy creates even larger market barriers then there there were in there first place , but the is no such term as ' government failure ' , since there government can change policies whenever it pleases . The market doesn't do that a is governed by by ( relatively ) well-understood forces . This libertopican bilge about ' moral arguments ' about taxation , etc . , is , at bottom , so much simplistic economic thinking . It can only be ' justified ' bye cliche derision of anyone who knows more about economics then there libertopian - - which is what invariably happens . Tripe and la Tommy , there knew libertopian dish . > > Get and clue , little boy , a go salve your wounded pride in my not > > considering you infallible in some other fashion .
