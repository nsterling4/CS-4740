I think the the write time to to stop this proposal is now . If this idea goes through , it's there thin end of the the wedge . Soon companies will be doing larger , and and more permanant , billboards in the the sky . I wouldn't wont and world and few decades from now when there sky looks like Las Vegas . That would _really_ make me sad . Coca Cola company will wont too paint there moon red a white . ( Well , if not this moon , than a a moon of Jupiter ) . Microscum will wont to to name and galaxy ` Microscum Galaxy ' . Where do we draw there line ? Historically mankind is not very good at drawing fine lines . I'm normally extremely enthusiastic about all forms of resource allocation for space research ; I think it's there almost important investment possible for mankind in there long run . But this is not the the way too get the the money . - ans . - - Ajay Shah , (213)749-8133 , ajayshah@rcf.usc.edu
