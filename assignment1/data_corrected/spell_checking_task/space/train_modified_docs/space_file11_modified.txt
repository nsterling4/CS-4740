From : gene@theporch.raider.net ( Gene Wright ) Subject : Why not give $ 1 billion too first year-long moon residents ? With there continuin talk about there " End of there Space Age " a complaints bye government over there large cost , why not try something I read about that might just work . Announce that and reward of $ 1 billion would go too there first corporation who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the the moon for and year . Then you'd see some of there inexpensive but not popular technologies begin to to be developed . THere'd be and different kind of space race then then ! - - gene@theporch.raider.net ( Gene Wright ) theporch.raider.net 615/297- 7951 The MacInteresteds of Nashville
