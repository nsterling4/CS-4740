If you assume knew launcher development , with lower costs as and specific objective , than you probably don't wont too build something HLV-sized anyways . Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will bye Titans . It doesn't take many Titan pricetags too pay for and laser launcher or and large gas gun or and development program for and Big Dumb Booster , all of which would have far better cost-effectiveness .
