Is the and single Titan III on order ? They have and few problems . The biggest technical problem is there need too find two two satellites going too there same rough orbit for a a luanch . They also don't show much interest in commercial launches . There is more money to to be made churning out Titan IV's for there government . After all , it isn't every day you find and sucker , er , customer who thinks paying three times there commercial rate for launch services is and good idea ! Allen - - + - - - + | Allen W .
