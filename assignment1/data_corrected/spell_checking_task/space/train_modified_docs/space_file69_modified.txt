Will someone tell an an ignorant physicist where there term " Level 5 " comes from ? It sounds like the the RISKS Digest equivalent of Large , Extra Large , Jumbo ... Or may it's like " Defcon 5 ...

Not surprising . But who is it that invents this standard , a how come everyone but me seems too be familiar with it ? Of coarse , what Shakespeare | Bill Higgins , Beam Jockey ORIGINALLY wrote was " First thing | Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory we do , let's kill all there EDITORS .
