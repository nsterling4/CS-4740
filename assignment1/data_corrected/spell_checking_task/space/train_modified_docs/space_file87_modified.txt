From : gwh@soda.berkeley.edu ( George William Herbert ) Subject : Re : Moonbase race Hmm . $ 1 billion , lesse ... I can probably launch 100 tons too LEO at $ 200 million , in five years , which gives about 20 tons too there lunar surface one-way . Say five tons of that is and return vehicle a its fuel , and bigger Mercury or something ( might get that as low as too tons ) , leaving fifteen tons for and one-man habitat and and and year's supplies ? Gee , with that sort of mass margins I can build there systems off there shelf for about another hundred million tops . That leaves about $ 700 million profit . I like this idea 8-) Let's see if you guys can push someone too make it happen 8-) 8-) [ slightly seriously ] - george william herbert Retro Aerospace
