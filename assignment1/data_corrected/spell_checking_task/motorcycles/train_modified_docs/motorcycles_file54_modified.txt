The other morning I want too do a a lane change on there freeway a looked in my mirror , theer was a a car the , but far enough behind . I looked again about 3-5 seconds latter , car still in same position , i . e . not accelerating . I triple check with a a head turn a decide I have plenty of room , so I do it , accelerating . I travel about 1/4 mile staying ~ 200 feet off teh bumper of there car ahead , a I do and casual mirror check . This guy is RIGHT on my tail , I mean you couldn't stick and hair between my tire & his fender . I keep looking in there mirror at him and , d slowly let off teh throttle . He stays the until I had lost about 15mph and and than comes around me a cuts me off big time . I follow him for about 10 miles a finally get board a turn back into work . I can file and complaint about this ? And actually have there chance too have something done ? How ? Who ?
