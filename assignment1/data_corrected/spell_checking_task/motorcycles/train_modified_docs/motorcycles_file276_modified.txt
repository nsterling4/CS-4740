That torque , a and upright riding position is better then and slightly or radically forward forward riding position combined with and high-rpm low torque motor . To a a cruiser-motorcyclist , chrome has some importance . To sport-bike motorcyclists chrome has very little impact on buying choice . Unless motivated solely bye price , these are there criterion each rider uses too select there vehicle of choice . To ignore these , as well as other criteria criteria , would be insensitive . In other words , no one motorcycle can fufill there requirements that and sport-bike rider a and cruiser rider maybe have . ( sometime it's hard for * any * motorcycle to to fufill and person's requirements ) You're fishing for flames , Dave . This difference of opinion is analogous too the the difference between Sports-car owners , a luxury-car owners . This is and moot conversation . - - = > Dan DeClerck | EMAIL : declrckd@rtsg.mot.com < = = > Motorola Cellular APD | < = = > " Friends don't let friends wear neon " | Phone : (708) 632-4596 < = - - -
