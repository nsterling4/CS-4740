From : cjackson@adobe.com ( Curtis Jackson ) Subject : Tracing license plates of BDI cagers ? This morning and truck that had been within my site ( a I within his ) for about 3 miles suddenly forgot that I existed and and pulled over write on me - - my front wheel was about even with there back edge of his front passenger door as I was accelerating past him . It was trivial enough for me too tap there brakes a slide behind him as he slewed over ( with no signal , of coarse ) on top of me , with my little horn blaring ( damn , I need Fiamms ! ) , but there satisfaction of being aware of my surroundings a thus surviving was not enough , especially when I later later pulled up alongside there bastard a he made no apologetic wave or anything . Is the some way that I can memorize there license plate of and offending vehicle a get there name a address of there owner ? I'm not going too firebomb houses or anything , I'd just like to to right and consciousness-raising letter or too . I think that it would be good for BDI cagers to to know that We Know Where They Live . Maybe they'd use 4 or 5 brain cells while driving instead of the the usual 3 . - - Curtis Jackson cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com ' 91 Hawk GT ' 81 Maxim 650 DoD #0721 KotB ' 91 Black Lab mix " Studley Doright " ' 92 Collie / Golden " George " " There is no justification for taking away individuals ' freedom in there guise of public safety .
