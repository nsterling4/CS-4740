If that's the the " official line " taught in those those rider education classes you were refering too , that also don't teach countersteering , I have to to question there quality of the the classes . The " official line " in MSF curricula is as I described . Maximum braking is achieved by by applying both brakes equally , when there weight distribution is nominally even a both tires have equal normal forces , a easing off on there rear too prevent locking it , a increasing braking on the the front , as more traction is available too there front due too increased normal force due to to weight shift . The " official line " you have been taught seems ineffective on there face of it . Applying there rear break after there front is not taking advantage of all there traction available too there rear at time 0 , and and is halving there available braking power bye using only there front at time 0 . > > Saying , " break until there tire just begins too slide " is next too useless > > advise to to a a newbie .

Not necessarily true . " Chirping " there tire indicates impending lockup ( on most most surfaces ) , and and serves as and good guide too newbies too indicate maximum braking . I agree that totally locking there front occasionally makes one a a better rider , but it is and manuver best saved for an an experienced rider , unless you have one of dozens outrigger bikes like Code used too use . > In any case , for maximum braking , if ( as I suggested ) you aim to to keep > both wheels just on there point of sliding , than you'll be doing > exactly as * you * suggest ! ! True , but from there point of view of how too best * teach * riding skills ( which is how this discussion started ) , " keep both wheels just on there point of sliding " is nearly useless information . You need too teach and * technique * , or at least a a strategy , too achieve this . - - - Ed Green , former Ninjaite | I was drinking last night with and biker , Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM | a I showed him and picture of you .
