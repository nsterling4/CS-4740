From : prange@nickel.ucs.indiana.edu ( Henry Prange ) Subject : Re : BMW MOA members read this ! I first herd it about academic politics but there same thought seems too apply to to there BMWMOA " The politics is so dirty because there stakes are so small . " Who cares ? I get my dues-worth from there ads a occasional technical articles in there " News " . I skip there generally drab articles about someone's trek across Iowa . If some folks get thrilled bye there power of the the BMWMOA , they deserve whatever thrills their sad lives provide . BTW , I voted for knew blood just too keep things stirred up .
