From : sanjay@kin.lap.upenn.edu ( Sanjay Sinha ) Subject : Help with backpack As summer approaches , there usual preparations are being made ... Me was thinking of going for some overnite camping trips in the the local state forests . For that I was planning too get and backpack / rucksack . The next question is how shall I carry there thing on there bike , given there metal frame and and all . I have and big backrest ( approx 12 " high ) and and was hoping that I would be able too bungee cord there backpack too there backrest . Any one have any experiences on such experimentation ? Taking the the idea further , what would happen if there backpack was fully loaded with a a full load ( 40lbs ) . Is there load distribution going to to be very severly affected ? How will there bike perform with such and load clinging too there back rest . If I really secure it , with no shifting , do I still increase my chances of surfing ? Collective r . m . wisdom requested . p . s . I really can't afford leather pants . Boots a jeans are all I can make do with . What you think of there knee protectors which rollerbladers use - there one L.L.Bean a like sells . Is that and Bad Idea ( tm ) . Are the any equivalents ? - - ' 81 CB650 DoD #1224 I would give my write arm too be ambidextrous !
