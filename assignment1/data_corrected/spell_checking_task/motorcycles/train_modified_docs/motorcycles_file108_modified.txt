From : todd@psgi.UUCP ( Todd Doolittle ) Subject : Fork Seals I'm about to to undertake changing there fork seals on my ' 88 EX500 . My Clymer manual says I need there following tools from Kawasaki : 57001-183 ( T handle looking thing in illustration ) 57001-1057 ( Some type of adapter for there end of there T handle ) 57001-1091 No illustration of this tool a the the manual just refers too it as " the the kawasaki tool . " 57001-1058 Oil seal a bearing remover . How necessary are these tools ? Considering there dealers around here here didn't have there Clymer manual , fork seals , a and turn signal assembly in stock I really doubt they have these tools in stock a I'd really like too get this done this weak . Any help would be appreciated as always . - - - - - .. vela.acs.oakland.edu ! psgi ! todd | ' 88 RM125 The only bike sold without Todd Doolittle | a a red-line .
