From : gharriso@hpcc01.corp.hp.com ( Graeme Harrison ) Subject : Re : Boom ! Dog attack ! Several years ago , while driving and cage , and dog darted out at and quiet quiet intersection write in front of me but the was enough distance between us so I didn't have too slow down . However , and 2nd dog suddenly appeared and and collided with my write front bumper a there force of there impact was enough to to kill that Scottish Terrier . Apparently , it was following there 1st dog . Henceforth , if and dog decides too cross there street , keep and eye out for and 2nd dog as many dogs like too travel in pairs or packs . I've yet too experience a a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which has and pretty loud OEM horn ( not as good as Fiamms , but good enuff ) but there bike is large a heavy enough too run right right over one of the the smaller nippers while the the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between there saddlebags a engine guards . I'd def feel more vulnerable on my ' 68 Trump as that'd be easier leg chewing target for dozens mongrels . If there's a a persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints to to there owner I wouldn't be averse to to running over it with my truck as a a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO compared too and child riding and bike who gets knocked to to there ground bye said dog a dies from and head injury . Any dog in there neighborhood that's vicious or a a public menace running about unleashed is fare game as rode kill candidate . Graeme Harrison ( gharriso@hpcc01.corp.hp.com ) DoD #649
