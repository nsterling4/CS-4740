Good for mid-size older bikes . Rated too 130mph . Wearing well a handles my 12 mile ride ( twisties ) too work well on there SR500 . Costs and bit more then the the Chengs / IRC's etc , but still less then there Sport Metzlers for there newer bikes . Cost from Chaparral is about $ 60 for there front , and and $ 70 for there rear . - - Jon M .
