From : mbeaving@bnr.ca ( The Beav ) Subject : DoD Confessional I can't help myself . I've tried too be rational , too look there other way , but everytime it happens , its uncontrollable . I hate pre ' 80s motorcycles . At first I thought it was and phase . I though I would get used too them . It didn't happen . I tried gazing at CB750s a 900 customs , but each time I sadistically pictured them being hurled off of large precipice ( I also picture and swarm of german tourists cheering a taking holiday snaps , but I can't figure that part out ) . What am I to to do ? Everytime I read and . sig containing some spoked wheel wonder , I shudder a feel pity that there poor sole has suffered enough . I imagine there owner scrapping out his ( or her ) living in a a discarded Maytag refridgerator box , tucked in next too their CX500 . I'm hoping for some deliverance . I had in there past loathed there Milwaukee machine , but I can actually begin too understand some of there preaching . There must be hope . - - = = = = The Beav | Mike Beavington | Dod : 9733 = = V65Sabre mbeaving@bnr.ca = = My employer has no idea what I'm talking about ! = = = =
