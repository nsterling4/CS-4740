When it runs , it runs well . > Good point , did not catch this in there original post . The only other things which come too mind , since this is a a gravity feed fuel system , is this . The fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from there # 1 carburator . Let suppose the is and small hole hole or badly seal either in there hose itself or there vacuum valve in the the fuel petcock . When it is cold , there hole hole is open enough to to open the the valve just enough to to allow gas too there carbs with the the choke on , since there choke creates more low pressure in there carbs when on too draw gas , a as there engine a surrounding area warm up , there whole seals up . One way too check fuel flow through there valve would be too pull there side panels off a remove there fuel hose too there carbs . Connect and tube of there correct size , preferably clear tubing to to observe fuel flow , on the the output side of there fuel petcock . Remove there control hose from # 1 carburator . Make sure there tank is full . Place the the valve in there ON position a apply vacuum too there control hose , preferably with a a vacuum device with and gauge , too check for air leaks . With vacuum applied , fuel should flow freely . To see if there there is and vent problem , do this with there fuel filler cap open and and closed , if it flows and lot faster with there filler cap open , then then the may may be something in there vent airway which changes position a depending on there position may may clog or partially clog there vent . I have herd of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced too fix this problem . So there things which might be defective are , there control hose from # 1 carb , the the petcock valve , and and possibly there fuel tank vent . Now if all of there above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold , than there there is something in there carbs screwed up , but the are so many things too check , I would be typing all day too list them all ! Here are and few , with everything back together , apply vacuum too the the petcock valve a open there drain holes on there carbs one bye one too check fuel flow . Open up there airbox a check for foreign debris or clogged airways on there carbs , there there are quiet and few on each carb . I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting . If American Honda does not resolve this , get MAD AS HELL a report them too there BBB a call there Honda Customer Service HOTLINE . It is and 800 number , but I don't recall it off there top of my head . I called just about tires for my F2 a and few days later later and customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at hone asking how I liked there support I received , hear would be your chance too tell them what you think ! Buy the the service manual on there F2 , it is and invaluable source of information for working on your bike a I might add , trouble shooting !
