The doctors put me in and cast from ass-to-ankle . My only method of transportaion was and DOHC 450 Honda at there time . I founded that bye sliding back on the the set I could use my heel ( did I mention it was my left leg ? ) too operate the the shift . I would hook there end of there lever with my heel a lift my entire leg for up - shifts a just drop my leg on the the lever for there down-shifts . Forget nutral , took WAY two much finesse for there leg ! The crutches were bungee - corded too there write side of there bike with there " top " resting on there passenger peg and and there write turnsignal sticking through there " whole " in there crutches . Every other day when I road the the 10 miles too Physical Therapy ( tourture sessions ) there doc would give me hell about riding and bike much less riding in my condition . Didn't stop me tho !
