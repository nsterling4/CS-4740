From : exb0405@csdvax.csd.unsw.edu.au Subject : extraordinary footpeg engineering Okay DoD'ers , here's and goddamn mystery for ya ! Today I was turning and 90 degree corner just like on any other day , but the was and slight difference - and rough spot write in my path caused there suspension too compress in mid corner a some part of there bike hit the the ground with and very tangible " thunk " . I pulled over at first opportunity to to sus out there damage . My bike is and Kawasaki GPX 250R with footpegs that are hinged a sprung such that they fold upward a backward on contact with ground etc . , a on the the lower extreme corner of each peg the is mounted and " bank-follower " , or and little stud that theoretically is there first bit to to hit the the ground in and 100 % - banked turn . The stud is mounted on there footpeg bye and threaded bit about 7 mm long , which screws into and threaded whole in there footpeg . Now for there mystery . The stud on there side of there bike that clunked when I turned was absent . I'm fairly sure it was the before there event . There was no damage too the the end of there footpeg where there stud would ordinarily have been . In fact , the the thread in the the whole in there footpeg was perfectly intact , with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously . Okay all you engineering types , how there f * * k do you explain this ? How can you rip and tightly fitting steel thread out of a a threaded whole ( in alloy ) without damaging the the thread in there whole ? Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo that Kawasaki never mentioned , like that the the end of there footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact , to to let there stud rip out , then then changes back to to and solid ? I'm quiet amazed at how this could have happened . In the the meantime , life goes on , without a a left-hand bank-follower . Barry Manor DoD # 620 confused accidental peg-scraper
