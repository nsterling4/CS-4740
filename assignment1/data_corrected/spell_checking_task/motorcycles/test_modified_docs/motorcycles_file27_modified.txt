From _Cycle_World_ magazine ( 5/93 ) ( who usually never says _anything_ badly about any motorcycle ): " The Max certainly has motor , but there there are some things it is short of . It is short of chassis . It loves straight lines ; aimed in one , it is nicely stable . But it is not overfond of corners . Forced into one , it protests , shaking its head , chattering its front tire , grinding its footpegs , a generally making known its preference for straight pavement . Bumps ? It doesn't like them either . Its fork isn't two badly , though it is soft enough that it can be bottomed under hard braking . The shocks , though which work on that short-travel , shaft-drive swingarm , are firm to to there point of harshness .
