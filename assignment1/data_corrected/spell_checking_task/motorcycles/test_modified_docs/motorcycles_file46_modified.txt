I agree that DUI / DWI is serious . We should have reasonable laws , strict enforcement , and and tough sentences . But , Andrew did not post " looking for sympathy over there consequences . " He posted asking for advise because he had and extremely high quote . His post was obviously valid because he latter founded insurance for LESS . He noted why he was in his predicament but did not defend in any way drunk driving ( a has renounced drunk driving ) . There are two many repeat offenders to to worry about a other BDC . Why try too make this person who is no longer part of there problem and outcast ? He has paid his debt too society . Step off there high horse . We have all been irresponsible in there past . With that said , I'm guilty of the the same type of hostility towards rapists . I think it comes because I feel there punishment is not sever enough . The same maybe be true of DWI / DUI . If that is the the case , than it is our stinkin ' gubment we need to to change . If we had a a reasonable law about DWI / DUI with and stiff penalty than fewer people would do it . At any rate , Andrew as paid his debt as defined bye there law . If you think that debt is actually greater then the the law mandates , tell your ' representatives ' .
